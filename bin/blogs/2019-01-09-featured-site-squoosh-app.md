This web application was launched by Google's Chrome team at the 2018 [Chrome Developer Summit](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/) to demonstrate some of the techniques and possibilities for modern web applications.

Squoosh uses Web Assembly, workers, web components, and TypeScript to deliver a rapidly loading, powerful image compression tool. You can learn more about how it was implemented in the [presentation by Jake Archibald and Mariko Kosaka](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/complex-js-web-apps).

Squoosh is [open source](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh), hosted on Netlify, and makes use of Netlify's custom header control and simple redirects API.

We use it. We love it.
