Last month we hosted the [first ever JAMstack](http://activeingredients.info/) focused conference, and are happy to share the videos for those who were unable to attend.

The conference focused on the active ingredients within modern web workflows. There were talks covering every aspect of the JAM, so if you're looking to learn about the core concepts of Design Systems and the best way to get from design to production, check out Diana Mounter's talk about [**Design Systems, when and how much?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx02SaL_IH0&list=PLzlG0L9jlhEOwdVv4nJZW6c_MCLbmfs4z&index=10)

If you're into using Serverless, check out my talk on making a [**Frontend with a server-less stack**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpveOehxvoM&list=PLzlG0L9jlhEOwdVv4nJZW6c_MCLbmfs4z&index=1).

And of course, if you're curious how we got here, check out Netlify's CEO, Matt Biilman, speaking on [**the Rise of the JAMstack**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWTMEDEPw8c).

There are plenty of other great talks out there, so watch them all and continue to spread the JAM!
