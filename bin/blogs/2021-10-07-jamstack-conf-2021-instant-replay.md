And that’s a wrap on [Jamstack Conf 2021](https://jamstackconf.com/)! This was our community’s biggest virtual event to date and there are so many people to thank for bringing it to you, from all of our speakers and sponsors to hosts and lightning launch presenters, and more. 

If you tried to join yesterday's event at the start, you likely experienced low-quality audio and video. We lost power and network connectivity on set due to a wrestling match [between a bird and a transformer.](https://patch.com/california/sananselmofairfax/wayward-bird-triggers-marin-power-outage-pg-e) Thanks to all who helped us ⚡ power⚡ through and make the event a success once we got the power back on!

### Jamstack Community Survey 2021 results are now available 

We asked, you answered! This year’s survey shows Jamstack is rapidly becoming the mainstream architecture for web developers of every experience level. Highlights:

* Jamstack is the go-to architecture for new developers — Jamstack is quickly becoming the primary home for not only experienced web developers, but also those with less experience, including students. 
* Location agnostic — Remote work has become particularly high among Jamstack developers, with nearly a third (31%) of people saying their working life is now fully remote due to the global pandemic - and plan to stay that way. Where developers are located has also diversified, with newer developers proving to be significantly more geographically diverse.
* Jamstackers are building for scale — Nearly a third (32%) of Jamstack developers report the sites they build are for audiences of millions of users. 
* Security is top of mind — Jamstack developers are taking security more seriously than a year ago, with an overwhelming majority prioritizing security over speed of development. 
* Popular tools and frameworks include React, TypeScript, Figma and more. Plus, a next generation of frameworks is on the rise with 11ty and Svelte.

### Astro 0.21 Preview

The Skypack team shared an Astro 0.21 release preview. Astro’s newest launch provides even faster development with a new runtime backed by Vite. In the example given at Jamstack Conf, the results on v0.21 are almost 3x faster cached, and 20x faster uncached. 

Also new to v 0.21, Astro is now WASM powered! New compiler is written in Go, which makes it run-time agnostic--it can run in the browser, and in the future, anything that runs WASM. It powers new features, like the ability to pass variables into styles and scripts, render whitespace, and streaming HTML mode.
