Working with Hasura and Nuxt is one of the most straightforward ways I've personally found to create a Jamstack app with GraphQL, and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about the developer experience.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be building:<br>
[hasura-nuxt-demo.netlify.app](https://hasura-nuxt-demo.netlify.app/)

Here‚Äôs the repo:<br>
[github.com/sdras/favegame](https://github.com/sdras/favegame)

We‚Äôll be scoping it to just the basic functionality for the purposes of clarity, but you can build far richer experiences from here with a lot of ease. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Setting up

First, create a free [Hasura account](https://hasura.io/)- it will prompt you if you would like to bring your own Postgres database (or what I like to call BYOP) or link a new or existing Heroku account to create a new database. Choose whichever option suits you (I linked my Heroku account).

From there, create a new project. In that project, you‚Äôll create a table and add the fields you‚Äôll need. Our first table is `users` I needed an `id`, of type `Integer` (auto-incrementing), name, of type `Text` (another name for `String` :) ), and `profileImg`, which will be of type `Text` as well.

![Screenshot of Hasura's "Add a new table" form](/img/blog/image7.png)

From there, insert some rows of dummy data in the **Insert Row** tab as well. If you switch to the **Browse Rows** tabs, you should see your dummy data populated.

Now, let‚Äôs create another table called `favoriteGames` and do the same. This time we‚Äôll use the same id, and name, but also add `rating` (Integer), and `image` (Text):

![Screenshot of Hasura's dashboard with favoriteGames table with new rating and image columns](/img/blog/image11.png)



Now, we should be able to go to the GraphiQL tab at the very top, test our first query, and see how it goes:

```js
query getGames {
  favoriteGames {
    id
    image
    name
    rating
  }
}
```

returns:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "favoriteGames": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "image": "mafia.jpg",
        "name": "Mafia",
        "rating": 5
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "image": "gta.jpg",
        "name": "Grand Theft Auto",
        "rating": 4
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "image": "jumanji.jpg",
        "name": "Jumanji",
        "rating": 3
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "image": "blackjack.jpg",
        "name": "Black Jack",
        "rating": 5
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "image": "fortnite.jpg",
        "name": "Fortnite",
        "rating": 5
      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "image": "minecraft.jpg",
        "name": "Minecraft",
        "rating": 4
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Great! But what we really want is a list of all of the games along with the relevant active users associated with each game. In order to create that association between the two tables, we need to create a relationship.

## Relationships

Let‚Äôs go back to our `users` table, and click on the `modify` tab. Here, we‚Äôll create one more field, called `gameId`. This will give us the ability to pick an associative id from the `favoriteGames` table. Let‚Äôs go back to our `browse rows` tab and add id numbers of some games as well.

![Screenshot of Hasura modify gameId](/img/blog/image13.png)

Now, go back to favoriteGames and click the relationships tab. In the table, specify an Array Relationship, name it gameUser, and reference the users table. 

The id of this table should have a relationship with the gameId you just created in the other users table.

![Screenshot of Hasura SQL relationships](/img/blog/image8.png)

Once you save it, you should see the array relationship reflected in the table in this tab:

`users . gameId  ‚Üí favoriteGames . id`

![Screenshot of Hasura SQL gameUser array relationships](/img/blog/image1.png)

Now we can go back to the top GraphiQL tab, and type in a new query, with that relationship:

```js
query getGames {
  favoriteGames {
    id
    image
    name
    rating
    gameUser {
      id
      name
      profileImg
    }
  }
}
```

Cool! Now we have our first set of data and relationships set up and ready to use in our application.

## Let‚Äôs Build the Nuxt App

Ok! Now let‚Äôs build out our Nuxt application. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of Nuxt, but if you aren‚Äôt aware of how to use it, I have a couple of [courses on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/sarah-drasner/) that show you how to set it up.

Let‚Äôs create the app:

`yarn create nuxt-app`

Follow the prompts, and for the last prompt, pick `static` (Jamstack app) as the deploy target. Then we‚Äôll add the packages we‚Äôll need:

`yarn add @nuxtjs/apollo graphql-tag`

### Our Nuxt Configuration

From here, we can open our nuxt.config.js and let it know we‚Äôll be using the module:

`modules: ["@nuxtjs/apollo"],`

and also add a section for Apollo:

```js
 apollo: {
   clientConfigs: {
     default: {
       httpEndpoint: process.env.HASURA_ENDPOINT
     }
   }
 },
```

You can see here that I am using an environment variable, I create a `.env` file at the base root of the project, and put in this endpoint:

```
HASURA_ENDPOINT=https://yourendpointhere.hasura.app/v1/graphql
```

You can find your endpoint at the top of the GraphiQL tab (it will say GraphQL endpoint).

## Bringing it into the store

In an application like this, you may want to pull the data from the Vuex store, if it‚Äôs fairly straightforward, so you can centralize your data sources. You might also want finite control over what data is pulled into what page. The app I built uses the Vuex store but I‚Äôll show you how to do it both ways.

In our store/index.js:

First we need to install gql:

```js
import gql from "graphql-tag";
```

Then we need the state, where we‚Äôll eventually store our favoriteGames:

```js
export const state = () => ({
 favoriteGames: \[]
});
```

In actions, we‚Äôll call out to Apollo, using this.app to access it. We‚Äôll create our query using gql, and then commit a mutation:

```js
export const actions = {
 async callApollo({ commit }) {
   let response = await this.app.apolloProvider.defaultClient.query({
     query: gql`query GetGames {
         favoriteGames {
           id
           image
           name
           rating
           gameUser {
             id
             name
             profileImg
           }
         }
       }`
   });

   await commit("updateFavoriteGames", response.data.favoriteGames);
 }
};
```

Now let‚Äôs create that mutation that will store this data in state:

```js
export const mutations = {
 updateFavoriteGames: (state, data) => {
   state.favoriteGames = data;
 }
};
```

Finally, we have to dispatch this action. I‚Äôll create a plugin that I‚Äôll call from the server using `.server.js` as the suffix of the filename:

plugins/getGames.server.js

```js
export default async ({ store }) => {
 await store.dispatch("callApollo");
};
```

Now, if I register that plugin in `nuxt.config.js`, any time I build the site, it will gather all the data for me in the Vuex store!

```js
plugins: [`~/plugins/getGames.server.js`],
```

You can look in your devtools at the Vuex tab and see the data coming in as it should:

![favoriteGames data in devtools at the Vuex tab](/img/blog/image14.png)

Awesome! Now we've created a relationship with our data from Hasura and our application.

Now I can add the data to my views as usual. In pages/index.vue:

```js
<template>
 <div class="container">
   <h1>Favorite Games</h1>

   <main class="game-container">
     <section v-for="game in favoriteGames" :key="game.id">
       <AppGame :game="game" />
     </section>
   </main>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import { mapState } from "vuex";
import AppGame from "@/components/AppGame.vue";

export default {
 components: {
   AppGame
 },
 computed: {
   ...mapState(["favoriteGames"])
 }
};
</script>
```

Hooray! üéâ

### Alternatively, Per-Page

```
import gql from "graphql-tag";

export default {
 apollo: {
   favoriteGames: {
     query: gql`query MyQuery {
         favoriteGames {
           id
           image
           name
           rating
           gameUser {
             id
             name
             profileImg
           }
         }
       }`,
     update(data) {
       return data.favoriteGames;
     }
   }
 },
}
</script>
```

You can see [this implementation here](https://github.com/sdras/favegame/blob/a22acff572c545492f2021f16ec623f29b8a8ece/pages/index.vue).

## Deploy the App to Netlify

In order to deploy our Nuxt application, we will hook our GitHub or GitLab repo to our project by logging into Netlify, finding the repo and connecting it, and then selecting these options:

Build command:<br>
`yarn generate`

Publish directory:<br>
`dist`

We‚Äôll also go into the **Settings** tab at the very end, scroll down to **Environment**, and the **Environment Variables** section, and add in the same endpoint you did to the `.env` file you had locally:

![Netlify env settings hasura endpoint key value variable](/img/blog/image4.png)

And there we have it! Our app is living on the internets:

![Favorite Games app live](/img/blog/favegamescreen.jpg)

## Finally, let‚Äôs subscribe to updates

We can create a [build hook in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=graphql-hasura-sd&utm_campaign=devex) to trigger a rebuild, go again to the settings tab, to Build & Deploy, and then to Build Hooks. I called this one Hasura. Grab the link from here:

![Netlify build hook hasura api link](/img/blog/image9.png)

Finally, back in the Hasura dashboard, we‚Äôll click on the Events tab at the top, name the hook Netlify, and add the hook:

![Hasura dashboard event trigger with webhook link](/img/blog/image10.png)

Click the **Create Event Trigger** button and you‚Äôre all set! Now you‚Äôve created a relationship between both accounts, so that when you update your `favoriteGames` table, Netlify knows to trigger a build and repopulate that data.

Hope this small app helped get you started on these great technologies, so that you can build apps with ease!
