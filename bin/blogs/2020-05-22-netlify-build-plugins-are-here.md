We are excited to announce the release of [Netlify Build Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/plugins/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=bp-release-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) today! Build Plugins allow you to automate build tasks, customize your build process, and make your development process even easier. As a user of Build Plugins, you can take advantage of the one-click installs to [cache files](https://github.com/jlengstorf/netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache), [check for broken links](https://github.com/munter/netlify-plugin-checklinks), [trigger testing](https://github.com/tkadlec/netlify-build-plugin-speedcurve), and more. As a developer, creating Build Plugins keeps us in the realms of the familiar, relying on a plain 'ol JavaScript at its base.

Build Plugins are an additional piece of code that you can use by [adding them to your `netlify.toml` configuration file](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=bp-release-tzm&utm_campaign=devex#install-a-plugin) or clicking the 'Install' button on your [Build Plugins page](https://app.netlify.com/enable-beta). Then, when you deploy or build your Netlify site, the code will run in the background at a designated event of the [build process](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/). Plugins we have now will [look for accessibility failures](https://github.com/sw-yx/netlify-plugin-a11y), [add instagram](https://github.com/philhawksworth/netlify-plugin-add-instagram), [check for misspelled brand words](https://github.com/tzmanics/netlify-plugin-brand-guardian), and even [check if you're deploying outside of your set deployment hours](https://github.com/neverendingqs/netlify-deployment-hours-plugin). _That list is just skimming the surface of what you can do with Build Plugins_.

Although I could talk about Build Plugins for days, I thought I'd share with you some great resources from the community and our team at Netlify instead. Here are some resources, a list of posts on creating and using plugins, followed by a list of Build Plugins available today!

Speaking of the talented devs in our community. Let's look at some of the awesome plugins they have created.

## Build Plugins' Repos

You can see all the available Build Plugins listed in this [list](https://github.com/netlify/plugins). Here are a few plugins, a little information about them, and their repos.

### [Sentry Build Plugin repo üîó](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-netlify-build-plugin)

Already using Sentry and want an easy way to incorporate it into your build? This plugin notifies Sentry of new releases being deployed to your site.

### [Prerender SPA repo üîó](https://github.com/shortdiv/netlify-plugin-prerender-spa)

This plugin prerenders each page of your single page application (SPA). Using Netlify forms? Prerender SPA will aid in the discovery process with that too!

### [Fetch Feeds repo üîó](https://github.com/philhawksworth/netlify-plugin-fetch-feeds)

Fetch Feeds is a very aptly named plugin (and if you know it's author, [Phil Hawksworth](https://www.netlify.com/authors/phil-hawksworth/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=bp-release-tzm&utm_campaign=devex), you'd know that's a feat in itself). If you have an RSS feed or a remote feed via JSON, this plugin pulls in the information and even caches it.

### [Visual Diff (Applitools) repo üîó](https://github.com/jlengstorf/netlify-plugin-visual-diff)

Using Applitools, this Build Plugin will run a visual diff test with Cypress and fail the build if there are visual differences. You can then review and approve the changes with Applitools and rebuild your site.

## Time to Build

I hope these resources help inform, entertain, and inspire you! There are so many ways Build Plugins can make your development process work better for you. If you have any questions, please join us in the [Netlify Community](https://community.netlify.com/c/Netlify-support/build-plugins). I can't wait to see how you make them work for you! Happy coding üë©üèª‚Äçüíª!
