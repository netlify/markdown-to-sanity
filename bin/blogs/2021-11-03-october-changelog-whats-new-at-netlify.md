Hi folks!

This year’s Jamstack Conf was our community’s biggest virtual event to date! Thank you to everyone who joined us. Don’t worry if you missed the show, you can check out the [Jamstack Conf 2021 Instant Replay](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/07/jamstack-conf-2021-instant-replay/) to catch what you missed or to revisit your favorite sessions.

And that’s not all that the Netlify team was up to in October.

Read on to discover what’s new at Netlify! 

## [Faster, more reliable page loads with update to On-demand Builders](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/25/faster-more-reliable-page-loads-with-update-to-on-demand-builders/)

Earlier this year, Netlify announced [early access for On-demand Builders](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/faster-builds-for-large-sites-on-netlify-with-on-demand-builders-now-in-early-access/), an open-framework solution to improve build times for large sites. This new update to the On-demand Builders beta introduces global persistence for content across all edge nodes, so site visitors get reliably faster response times—regardless of their geographic locations.

## [New Loom integration for Deploy Previews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/26/new-loom-integration-for-deploy-previews-record-screen-and-video-feedback-about-web-projects/)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hxALJVC7RI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We’re excited to announce that now Netlify users can record Loom videos right from a Deploy Preview and save as a comment to a Git pull or merge request. Now it’s easier than ever for you to leave async video feedback about your web projects using Deploy Previews!

## [Write your Netlify Functions using Rust](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/14/write-netlify-functions-in-rust/)

[Announcing experimental support for Rust in Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/14/write-netlify-functions-in-rust/)! Now Rust developers can benefit from Netlify’s streamlined workflow for building the backend of a web application, allowing you to focus on writing the business logic instead of provisioning servers, orchestrating deployments, or navigating verbose configuration.

* **Use LaunchDarkly Feature Flags with Netlify:** Feature flags are a great way of giving developers more control over the features they create. With just a bit of JavaScript, they eliminate the need to maintain multiple feature branches within your source code. The good news is the whole process can be automated.

* **Update to website Analytics:** In order to make Netlify analytics more reliable and stable, we’ve adjusted the way we report bandwidth information to match our billing data. Now the data reported in your console will better reflect actual bandwidth usage. [Read the community post for this feature update →](https://answers.netlify.com/t/update-to-analytics/46354)
