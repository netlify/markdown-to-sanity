Weâ€™ve been [watching the horizon for Nuxt 3](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/09/15/nuxt-3-is-on-the-horizon/), and the long awaited day is here: Nuxt 3 public beta is live! ðŸŽ‰

With this release, developers are now able to try out Nuxt 3 with all of its latest features such as:

* Smaller core â€“ Nuxt 3 will be 20% lighter than Nuxt2 in KB
* Faster dev environment â€“ Cold starts will be optimized with dynamic SSR code-splitting
* Latest Vue 3 features â€“ With support for new features like syntax support for script setup
* SSR Support â€“ With the new Nitro engine, users will be able to achieve SSR support with Nuxt and Netlify


The most exciting thing is you can deploy a Nuxt 3 project on Netlify today with one click!

[![Deploy on Nuxt 3 on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/nuxt-starter#NODE_VERSION=14&AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME=nodejs14.x)

Alternatively, if you want to do it yourself instead of clicking the button, all you need to do is run:

```bash
# Scaffold your Nuxt 3 project
npx nuxi init my-nuxt3-app

# Change directory in new project
cd my-nuxt3-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local dev server
npm run dev
```

Thatâ€™s it!
