We're big fans of the Software Engineering Daily podcast here at Netlify. 

In this episode Matt Biilmann, our very own co-founder and CEO, talks at length about the reasons for and the challenges of building the Netlify infrastructure. About  evolving for scale. And about the lessons learned from a background in music.

> Our key first insight was just that if we could make that way of working like really simple and really intuitive, then this new architecture, that we started to see emerging from early adopters... could scale.
>
> We could take that architecture and make it viable for pretty much every frontend developer out there.


Head over to Software Engineering Daily to hear the entire interview. Some fascinating listening!
