## What content matters most to you?

There's no shortage of things you can build on the Netlify platform. Have opinions on what content you'd like to see? Do you keep wishing we'd write a post about something specific? Help us help you, by taking this [Content Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8QC9VNH) and telling us what type of content you'd like to see.

We're invested in making it easier for teams to collaborate and run their sites. Are you a designer? A product manager? An engineering lead? A security reliability engineer? A content marketer? We'd love to learn more about who you are and the type of information you need to propel your projects to the next level.

This survey will help us hear from as many of you as possible and the info we learn from you will guide the blog posts and tutorials we create next. The more responses we get the better content we'll be able to provide.

The survey will run for **2 weeks** and analysis will take a few days. After we've pulled all the information we'll share what we learned and give you some sneak peeks into upcoming content.

Let us know what content you'd like to see and **[take the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8QC9VNH)**.
