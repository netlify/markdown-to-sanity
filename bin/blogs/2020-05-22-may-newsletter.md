## Environment variables and Netlify Deploy Previews get a boost
​
Making Deploy Previews and their corresponding build logs visible has long proven to be a popular and empowering part of the Netlify workflow. But what if a build uses environment variables that we’d rather not make public, like API keys or other secrets? Netlify now offers control over how environment variables are handled in the automated builds triggered by pull requests, and you can choose to 1) deploy without sensitive variables, 2) require approval to deploy, or 3) deploy without restrictions. Check out our [blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/19/environment-variables-and-preview-deploys-get-a-boost/) to learn more.
