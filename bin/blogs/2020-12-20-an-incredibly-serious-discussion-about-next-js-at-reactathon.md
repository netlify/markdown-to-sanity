Welcome to Blogvent, day 20!

Last week, Netlify sponsored [Reactathon](https://www.reactathon.com/), and we had a blast getting to know other developers in the community in our topic tables and around the event.

One of the talks was given by yours truly, and it was a very, very serious discussion about Next.js, its capabilities, and... maybe a *little* bit of fun things too.

## Wow! Can I see more?
Of course you can! If you'd like to learn how to write Next.js, we have a Mission just for you on [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=nextjsmission-cs&utm_campaign=devex)!

And [here's a starter project for Next.js](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter) if you'd like to get coding:
