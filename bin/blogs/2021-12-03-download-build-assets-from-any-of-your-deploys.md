Did you know that you could download the build assets from any one of your deploys?

It's true! Whether you uploaded all of your site's assets, or if they were generated in Netlify's servers by your build, you can download them as a zip file.

Download the snapshot of any of your previous site versions by clicking the download arrow in its Deploy Details page.

![Download arrow in the Deploy Details page](/v3/img/blog/ui-download-deploy-assets.jpg "Download your build assets")

We'll package up all of the assets from that deploy into one handy zip file for you to download.
