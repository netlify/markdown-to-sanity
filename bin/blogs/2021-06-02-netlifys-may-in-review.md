Hi folks!

Following a [big announcement](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/22/next.js-on-netlify-now-with-support-for-on-demand-builders-and-distributed-persistent-rendering/) in April to enhance support for Next.js and shorten build times for large sites, May was even bigger! We announced our first acquisition and the [next generation of Deploy Previews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/19/next-generation-deploy-previews-plus-netlify-acquires-featurepeek/) to help teams gather feedback faster on web projects. But thatâ€™s not all, weâ€™ve been making tons of product improvements and helpful updates for you! To help you sort through the flurry of announcements, we put together this changelog breaking down all the new things you can do with Netlify. Letâ€™s dive in!

### **[Configure Build Plugins by deploy context](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/06/now-available-configure-build-plugins-by-deploy-context/)**

You can now configure your Build Plugins by deploy context! Deploy contexts refer to the different types of deploys of your site on Netlify, including production deploys to your primary site URL, Deploy Previews, and branch deploys built from a specific branch of your site repository. With this new feature, you can choose which plugins run in each context, and configure plugins to run with different inputs per context.

### **[Create React App on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/create-react-app/)**

Create React App is a command line tool that generates a boilerplate React single-page application with a pre-configured build pipeline. It simplifies the complexity of setting up a React project, allowing you to focus on building out the app itself.

[Read the docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/create-react-app/) >

### **[File-based configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#functions)**

In addition to using the Netlify UI to configure build settings, deploy settings, and environment variables, you can now configure these settings in a netlify.toml file stored in the root of your site repository. The netlify.toml file is a configuration file that specifies how Netlify builds and deploys your site â€” including redirects, branch and context-specific settings, and more.

[Read the docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#functions) >

### **[Forms deletion in the Netlify UI ](https://answers.netlify.com/t/important-update-forms-deletion-has-landed/36723)**

Now you can delete your own forms through the Netlify UI! You no longer need to flag down a support team member. The Netlify Support team is very excited about this new capability and we hope you will be, too!
