Last month we launched Teams which provides our customers a way to collaborate
and manage their sites more efficiently.

Today we are introducing a new feature within Teams: Audit Log.

The Audit Log feature will be available for our Business customers and above.  Similar to our
deploy list, Audit Log provides transparency into the different actions taken by team
members on various team and site settings.

For now we are tracking the following team action categories:

- Team setting changes <img style="display: inline-block" src="/img/docs/audit-log-team.svg" alt="">
- Site setting changes <img style="display: inline-block" src="/img/docs/audit-log-site.svg" alt="">
- Split testing changes <img style="display: inline-block" src="/img/docs/audit-log-split-test.svg" alt="">


Audit logs are fully searchable and provide an overview and historical log into nearly
every action that can be taken by your team members.  We already track around 30
different actions that can be performed on teams and sites, and will be adding more as
we add and expand.

Feel free to read the [Audit Log docs][docs] and give Audit Log a shot ðŸ™‚.

Let us know what you think [@netlify][twitter].
