Curated is a searchable index of sites about web design. With sites suggested by the community it surfaces them through an elegant and performant interface.

We like this site not only because it is clean and snappy, but also because it is a great example of how to gather contributions from users by using tools and services which are readily available.

Submissions are via a Google Form, which [populates a Google Sheet](https://twitter.com/AntoinePlu/status/1105787060194033665). In turn this provides a data feed for the content of the site and a search powered by Algolia.

Simple. Crafty. Effective.
