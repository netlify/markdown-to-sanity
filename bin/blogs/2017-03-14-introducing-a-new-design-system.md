Netlify is growing.

As our user base and team grows, it’s natural our product would as well.

Since I joined this brilliant team we have shipped amazing new features at a incredible pace, and we have an exciting roadmap planned for the  future. However, this amazing pace means that sometimes our product’s current design  showed its limitations — if we want new features and our product to scale graciously, we needed our UI to do the same.

Our goal was to facilitate and accommodate, rather than create friction.

[Today we are rolling out the first of many iterations to our app‘s user interface.](https://app.netlify.com/)

## What’s wrong with the current design?

The problem we are solving is not the overall ‘look’ but instead how flexible the User Interface can grow while welcoming big and transformative features.

It’s easy for designers to fall in love with the **idea** of a redesign. It’s romantic, the idea of being able to redesign your product from scratch, no restrictions no limitations, it’s a product designer’s platonic dream.

It can also be a very dangerous trap.

A complete redesign is a massive project that can take months (sometimes years). They take up crazy amounts of resources and if you’re not solving a real problem, you are really wasting time and money. The whole Netlify team was aware of these pitfalls,  we carefully studied *how* we should do it, *which* problems were we solving, and *when* to do it. It was decided that now was the time.

## What we came up with.

Creating a more simple organizational structure and hierarchy for our application was the  first step, and reflecting that in our header and navigation was one of our top priorities.

Part of that new header is something that we are calling the 'Hero Card’.

Many of our users, after setting up their sites in Netlify, don’t really need to revisit the UI often. That’s one of the brilliant things about Netlify, you can set it, and forget it.

However, in the situation where you are going back to the UI, it’s ideal that for you to get in and get the job done as quickly possible.

The Hero Card is the first element that you see in most pages. It allows you to see a quick summary of the page and gives access to the most common/pertinent actions and information.

## What’s our game plan?

Our plan is to share a detailed look at our design process through the coming weeks. This will include our discoveries on subjects like typography, layout, processes, and some of the struggles we had to overcome.

Like I said, often a complete redesign of a product takes months and months of intense work to put in place which is why we are doing it in batches.

During the next week we are rolling out the new design system and structure (the look and feel). Right after that you can expect gradual improvements to the features that you know and love, and **brand new** features that we’ve diligently been working on. We can’t wait to get all of this into your hands.

We are excited to document our experiences and findings over the last few months in the [Designer’s Corner](https://www.netlify.com/tags/design/) section of our blog — please stay tuned! ✌️

_I personally want to thank the whole **Netlify team** for being so supportive, smart as hell, and help get these mockups into a real product; **Wilson Miner** for being a scary well of wisdom and insight, I cannot stress enough how honored I am being able to count on your support._

_And **You**, the Netlify user, for being the best, most passionate, smart group of people I’ve worked for._
