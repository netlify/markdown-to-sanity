Ever wonder how some people are able to write a blog post a day? Or how to write an in-depth technical blog post? Us too! That's why we decided to have an episode of the Remotely Interesting podcast to talk about just that. [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [Divya Tagtachian](https://twitter.com/shortdiv), [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), and [Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth) chat about how they have been successful with their blogging and also, maybe, not-so-successful.

The team also shares some posts and authors that they enjoy reading. So, whether you are able to "Divya" out and write a blog post a day for a month or go all "Jason" with 100,000+ words (ðŸš¨ hyperbole alert ðŸš¨) we support your efforts! We hope we can provide you some helpful tips or at least some commiseration. As always, we hope you find this episode remotely interesting.
