In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I host Zack Argyle to discuss what service workers are, and examine how Pinterest is using them for notifications and to cache JavaScript files.

They also detail the value of service workers for serving international markets with unreliable internet. Finally, they reveal Pinterestâ€™s vision to use service workers to deliver a more comprehensive offline experience.
