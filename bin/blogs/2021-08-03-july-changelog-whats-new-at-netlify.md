## **Improved developer experience for monorepos, better caching for Yarn workspaces**

If you work with monorepos on Netlify, you may be glad to know there‚Äôs some [swanky new documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/monorepos/?_gl=1%2aysnbuz%2a_gcl_aw%2aR0NMLjE2MjUxNjc3NzAuQ2owS0NRanc1dVdHQmhDVEFSSXNBTDcwc0xMYmoyajR5dnFUOWc1MlRTSTRIOFY0UnpLMS1oa2dBV09IZjVIOEpHaXN1M3N4cjRMZk1hNGFBdFJQRUFMd193Y0I.&_ga=2.218366937.1125764212.1626707843-1785732219.1626471639&_gac=1.120443258.1625167770.Cj0KCQjw5uWGBhCTARIsAL70sLLbj2j4yvqT9g52TSI4H8V4RzK1-hkgAWOHf5H8JGisu3sxr4LfMa4aAtRPEALw_wcB) available on this topic. We‚Äôve made some changes to the developer experience, too. Now, when you get started with a ‚ÄúNew site from Git‚Äù you‚Äôll find an optional field labeled ‚ÄúBase directory‚Äù to make configuration easier, and there‚Äôs also improved caching for Yarn workspaces.

## **What else is new at Netlify?**

### **[Build wicked fast sites with Astro](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/23/build-a-modern-shopping-site-with-astro-and-serverless-functions/)**

One of the hot new frameworks on the scene is Astro, and it‚Äôs all about shipping less client-side JavaScript. If you want to learn more, check out this handy [introduction to Astro.](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/08/build-wicked-fast-sites-with-astro-an-introduction/) When you‚Äôre ready to scale, there‚Äôs even a guide for building an e-commerce site with Astro and serverless functions. 

### **[Getting your e-commerce Jamstack site ready for Core Web Vitals](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/07/how-to-get-your-e-commerce-jamstack-site-ready-for-core-web-vitals/)**

Google‚Äôs latest ranking update includes the addition of three speed metrics to the search engine‚Äôs ranking algorithm. Learn what updates to Core Web Vitals you can expect in 2021, and how to optimize your Jamstack e-commerce website for them. 

### **[Easy access environment variables, managing environment variables with Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/05/easy-access-environment-variables/)**

When you need to keep a sensitive variable in a safe place, environment variables can help. With Netlify, you can manage your environment variables centrally in your site‚Äôs deploy settings admin, and [access them in your local build](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/12/managing-environment-variables-from-your-terminal-with-netlify-cli/) if you run your site with Netlify Dev.

### **[Open proxy deprecation](https://answers.netlify.com/t/recent-change-open-proxy-deprecation/39921)**

As part of our mission to build a better web, Netlify recently deprecated the ability to create open proxies, which can be a vector for abuse. Odds are, you are not impacted. Only a few dozen customers had configured an open proxy, and all have already been contacted directly. <br>

### **[Improved support for big `netlify.toml` files ](https://answers.netlify.com/t/improved-support-for-big-netlify-toml-files/40038)**

While most Netlify sites do not require much configuration, customizing a site‚Äôs settings can be quite useful. In some instances, for example for sites with a long list of redirects, users with unusually large `netlify.toml` files might experience build failures. We have just fixed this problem, bringing full support for `netlify.toml` files of any size.

Until next time!
