They say that time is money. That’s why site performance and the ability to iterate quickly are so critical for e-commerce. And because speed is one of the biggest benefits of the Jamstack architecture, e-commerce is often cited as the quintessential use case for a Headless architecture on the Jamstack.

[With more businesses going online and competing in the e-commerce marketplace](https://twitter.com/2PMinc/status/1261521046290739200), we want to help you understand the benefits of a headless model, how to architect your Headless Commerce applications on the Jamstack, how to pick the right stack and best practices for implementation.

On September 3, we’re hosting the first-ever **[Headless Commerce Summit](https://ti.to/netlify/headless-commerce-summit)**, bringing together top digital agencies, popular e-commerce brands and technology vendors in the Headless Commerce ecosystem to discuss best practices and plot the future of e-commerce.

Headless Commerce Summit is a half-day, virtual event for web development leaders interested in learning about the Jamstack web architecture, including headless e-commerce platforms, headless content management systems, APIs and modern development workflows.

**What is headless?** Headless is a term for backend services providing data and functionality without controlling the frontend UI. Headless systems communicate with frontends via APIs.

**What is Jamstack?** [Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) is a modern web architecture pioneered specifically as a companion to headless backend systems. Jamstack allows teams to develop rich, interactive UIs with modern frameworks and tools.

Some benefits of using a Jamstack architecture include improved site performance and reliability, the ability to iterate faster, and a huge increase in developer productivity using Jamstack workflows.

## Join us to learn more about headless + e-commerce + Jamstack

Headless Commerce Summit is the perfect opportunity to learn directly from your agencies and web engineering teams who are running large, production e-commerce sites on the Jamstack.
