Jamstack Conf is going virtual again!

[Register early](https://ti.to/netlify/jamstack_virtual_oct) to join us online, October 6-7, to explore the theme of "full service Jamstack." [Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) is a new approach to build faster, more secure websites and web applications. At this event, we’ll showcase the capabilities of the Jamstack architecture—way beyond static sites—to powering dynamic applications, personalization at the edge, and more. We’ll look back at what the community has accomplished in the past 5 years, the core tenants that make Jamstack so powerful, and inspire what's possible for the future of Jamstack.

Today we also announce our [call for proposals](https://bit.ly/3fRoZ4e)—submit your case studies, technical deep-dives, and reference implementations of the tools, services, and architectures that enable advanced Jamstack capabilities. We are seeking a range of speakers to add to our lineup to give 20-minute presentations and 10-minute lightning talks. We will continue to curate and invite speakers, but we will also feature a mix of community-generated speaking proposals. Be sure to submit your speaking proposals by August 12.

[Jamstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/) is for engineers, web architects, technology leaders and digital agencies who are embracing the next evolution of modern web development architecture. Earlier this year, we hosted our first virtual Jamstack Conf and welcomed 8,500 attendees from across 128 countries. We explored connecting at global scale, including the pragmatic role played by developers, devops and the web, and the future of Jamstack through case studies, new innovations and demos. [Check out the talks from our May event](https://bit.ly/jamstackvids).
