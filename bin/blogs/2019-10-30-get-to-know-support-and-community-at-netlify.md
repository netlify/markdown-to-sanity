Here at Netlify, we have the joy, every day, of working with a fantastic team of people dedicated to designing and building some of the world's most useful development tools. Together, we go to great lengths to make our products secure, stable, and easy to use – to the extent that most of our customers never need to ask for help! That said, we are equally proud of the team and efforts that go into supporting our customers when they do have questions, or things don't go quite as smoothly as expected –  and felt like it was time to give people a little more insight into how we Support at Netlify.

### How do I get support when I need it?

Have a problem with our service? Need to ask a question? Here are some tips from us to get the best help you need, when you need it. 

**1.) Follow NetlifyStatus on Twitter.**

If you are on twitter, we recommend you follow [@NetlifyStatus](https://twitter.com/netlifystatus?lang=en) to get realtime information on outages or known issues with our service. If we are experiencing problems, we will tweet updates from that account.

**2.) Check our status page.** 
If you can't access twitter or don't use it, check our status page if it seems like we might be experiencing problems. Head to [netlifystatus.com](https://www.netlifystatus.com/), which will always contain the most up-to-date information we have available on any issues with our services or 3rd party integrations we rely, on such as GitHub.

**3.) Head to Community**

If you are trying to fix a problem or get answers to a specific problem you are facing, your best bet is to head to our Community forums, as they are always busy and active – 24 hours a day! Staffed by support engineers and enthusiastic community members, it's very likely that someone else has seen your question before or has an answer for you already.  We also have Support Guides – in-depth how-to's that explain our most frequent problems. [Check out a list of those Support Guides here](https://community.netlify.com/c/Netlify-support/support-guides/52), or include the term "Support Guide" when you search Community. 

If you ask a new question, please provide as much information as possible – see below for tips on how to get the best help. The Support team is active in Community, and works with volunteers to ensure even your trickiest questions get responses. 

**4.) Stop by the Helpdesk**

If you are a member of a paid team, you also have the option of heading to the Helpdesk at [netlify.com/support](https://www.netlify.com/support/), where your question will be answered by one of our support engineers. Please ensure that you make your request with the email that is associated with your paid team so your request gets routed correctly. 

### Who you gonna call? Teams Support & Community!

Meet some of the members of Support & Community teams! When something goes wrong or interference happens, it is very likely you'll get help from will be one of our Support Engineers or our Community Manager who will be helping you out. We answer questions for our Starter Tier members in our Community forums, send status updates via the Netlify Support Twitter, and solve problems for customers who are members of paid teams in the Support Helpdesk.

### Another word about Community

We all have something to contribute! Community thrives due to the commitment and participation from everyone. The more people contribute in our forums, the quicker help will be available!

We do know that participating in public can be intimidating to new technologists – we hope you will join in to make Community welcoming to all Netlify fans!

### What information do I provide to get the best help?

As much as possible! [See this post for a detailed guide](https://community.netlify.com/t/asking-great-questions-to-get-great-answers/374) – but, in short, when you post in the Community, please make sure you mention any error messages, provide any build logs, outline anything you have tried to fix the issue, as well as providing your best guess as to what is causing the problem. The less questions community members or staff need to ask to get you help, the better.

### I got the help I needed- how can I give back?

Great! Seems like you had the experience you were hoping for. If you fix your own problem, please share your solution for other members. If you have an answer to someone else's problem, please stick around to tell them what they might try! Community works best if we all participate.

Of course, we always hope you won't need us – but if you do, know that we are here for you 24x7 with answers, support, and help.
