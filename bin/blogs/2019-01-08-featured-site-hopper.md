This beautifully designed, multilingual site includes all sorts of subtle, smooth visual touches and animation. Built with Gatsby and deployed to Netlify as a JAMstack site, Hopper.com sports a variety of information and a searchable jobs board.

Its impressive responsive design approach, with clever navigation optimisations for mobile devices when appropriate, and its consideration of performance all go towards making it a site we really like.
