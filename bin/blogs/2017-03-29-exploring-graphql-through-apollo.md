In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I chat with Sashko Stubailo and Jonas Helfer from Meteor to discuss Apollo, a set of tools developed to make GraphQL easier to use.

They explain that while GraphQL is a great technology, the ecosystem of tools for the technology is still developing. They also discuss Optics, a paid service that collects server data and delivers analytics and performance information.
