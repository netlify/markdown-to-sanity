Welcome to Blogvent, day 12!

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is one of our favorite places to experiment, prototype, and build fun web projects. Deploying a Pen to Netlify is super speedy, and a great way to get your projects live on your own domains for all to see!

It took longer to write this blog post than it took to take a Pen and deploy it to Netlify. It was so fast, in fact, that we recorded it:

First, export your Pen to a ZIP file. Then, go to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=codependrop-cs&utm_campaign=devex), then drag the `dist` folder from your exported Pen onto the page, and click the resulting new website. Done!

That's right, in less than 30 seconds, a Pen on Netlify. Woo!
