Wondering what would be the best way to share your Framer X prototypes more widely? Netlify offers a great starting point to get your prototypes up and running on the web in just a few seconds.

First, you need to export a [Web Preview on Framer](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/export-framer-x-project/).

![web preview folder](/v3/img/blog/created-folder.png "web preview folder")

This will create a new folder containing all your web-ready files that you will be uploading into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).

Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Drag & Drop the folder you just created. Done.

It's that simple.

We deploy your site and automatically generate a temporary address so you can immediately start sharing your prototype.

If you want to claim your site and make changes in the future, or perhaps add a [custom domain](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/) or [HTTPS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/), you can easily [sign up for a free Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

We're looking forward to seeing your creations, and as always, we're keen to see your thoughts and feedback over in the [Netlify Community forum](https://community.netlify.com/).
