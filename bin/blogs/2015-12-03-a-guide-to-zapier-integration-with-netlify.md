As you may have seen in yesterday's newsletter Netlify now has a [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/91512/a3f5925997e8159c733249013ba253fe/) in beta.

It lets you integrate form submissions or deploy notifications from Netlify to hundreds of external services like MailChimp, Hipchat, Google Docs, etc.

What that means is that in a few easy steps you can set up the app to send you a notification whenever a new form is submitted, or a deploy is finished and pushed live. The notification could be by email, a message in Slack, or almost anywhere else.

Check out the [Netlify integration beta invitation page](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/91512/a3f5925997e8159c733249013ba253fe/) to learn more about how Zapier works, and get started making your own Zaps with Netlify.
