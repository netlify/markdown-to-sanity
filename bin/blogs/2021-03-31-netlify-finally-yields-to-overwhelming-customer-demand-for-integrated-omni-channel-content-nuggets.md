> Update: Not everything lasts forever, so after gazillions of invaluable Netlify Stories shared, we regret to announce the retirement of this feature. It was a wild ride, but today is a new day.

**ONLINE – April 1, 2021 –** Netlify, pioneer of the modern Jamstack web architecture, today announced an integrated community content feature, after what it described as "a stirring, passionate, and generally unavoidable campaign from our customers."

"When customers tell us what they want, we listen. And now **everyone** has to listen, thanks to Netlify Stories, which position unsolicited community content front and center for users of the Netlify admin interface."

Netlify President Chris Bach made this announcement in a Netlify Story that we could not help but watch while we were looking at the logs from our serverless functions.

The launch of Netlify Stories positions Netlify as the latest entrant into the gigantic "ephemeral chatter via colorful circles at the top of the page" category.

Anonymous sources within Netlify claim that the official feature name and strap-line, *"Netlify Stories — Be the talk of the town while being talked at!"* was selected after significant internal infighting and that their own suggestion, *"Netlify Neets — The yeet-est fleets ye’ll ever meet"* failed to get the traction they felt it deserved.

Netlify Stories are available today exclusively to those on our [starter plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/). Find the Stories on your [Team Overview page](http://app.netlify.com) and enjoy making a deeper connection with your fellow Netlifriends.

If you prefer a more traditional means of sharing your stories and experiences with us, we’ll also glance at our [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/netlify) Twitter account from time to time until Netlify Stories becomes the dominant social media channel. (Or you could [visit our Forums](https://answers.netlify.com/t/new-product-update-neets-aka-netlify-fleets-aka-netlify-stories/35236) for more discussion)

These stories might be ephemeral, but the feature will last forever. Probably.
