Server-side render client applications have become increasingly more popular in the last few years and the main focus for a lot of teams transitioning to frontend libraries, like React. I took some time to chat with Trey Huffine, a software engineer from Postmates, to chat about their decision removing their dependency on server-side rendering from the Postmates and how that affected them. We discuss the pros and cons of server-side rendering and the joys of React.
