When we publish a post on Contentful, we typically want our site to rebuild to include it. In this post we'll go over Netlify's webhooks, which allows Netlify to accept HTTP POST requests as a signal to trigger new builds when content updates.

It's fairly straightforward to set this up, though it does require some configuration within Contentful and some within Netlify.

## Within Netlify

Go to `Settings â†’ Build & Deploy` ([sign up for free](https://app.netlify.com/signup) if you don't have a Netlify account). From there, scroll down to `Build Hooks`, and enter the name of the hook, as well as the branch to build from (typically `Contentful` and `master`

From there we can save, and it will give us a URL endpoint:

![Netlify build hooks settings page](/img/blog/screen-shot-2020-04-23-at-9.23.28-pm.png)

Now we can hook this up to Contentful.

## Within Contentful

Once you're logged in, navigate to `Settings â†’ Webhooks` from the bar at the top. From there, click on `Add webhook`, and select `Netlify` from the options. Choose a name that will help you associate the project, and enter the URL of the site

From there, we'll be taken to a screen that allows us to enter the endpoint we got from Netlify, as well as some settings that we can adjust for our needs:

Here we can choose what types of content editing events will call our new Build Hook. 

Now, when we publish or edit posts in Contentful, we'll see a new build happening with the [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/), pulling in our content and publishing it to our site! ðŸŽ‰ If you're interested in trying out Contentful, we've prepared a [one-click template and tutorial that can get you started](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/20/create-a-blog-with-contentful-and-nuxt/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=contentful-sd&utm_campaign=devex).
