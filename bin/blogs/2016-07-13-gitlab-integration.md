We are very excited to announce that you can use GitLab to authenticate and deploy repositories in Netlify.

With GitLabâ€™s increased popularity, we've received a great deal of requests to integrate their service into Netlify.

Starting today, in addition to GitHub and Bitbucket, you'll be able to choose GitLab when you signup and create new sites in Netlify.

We're very excited to help more developers craft their sites and web applications. This is just the beginning of the new features we plan to release to make it even easier to deploy new sites and collaborate with your team in Netlify.
