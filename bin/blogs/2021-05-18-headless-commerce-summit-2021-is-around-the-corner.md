[Headless Commerce Summit](https://headlesscommercesummit.com/#register) is a free half-day, virtual event for web development leaders interested in learning about the Jamstack web architecture, including headless e-commerce platforms, headless content management systems, APIs and modern development workflows.

Whether you’re just learning about headless e-commerce, you’ve already started to go headless, or you're a Jamstack pro, this conference will give you insights and actionable information to make your site and your business move faster.

### Headless Commerce: e-commerce on the Jamstack

What’s headless commerce? [Headless](https://jamstack.org/glossary/headless-technology/) is an architectural approach where backend services providing data and functionality are decoupled from the frontend UI. Jamstack is a modern web architecture pioneered specifically as a companion to headless backend systems.

For commerce companies, the benefits of a Jamstack architecture can include improved personalization and customer experience, better site performance and reliability, and the ability to iterate faster.

They’ll walk through simple, incremental migration strategies on the Jamstack, and how to improve developer workflows and boost productivity with headless architecture.

### Caching strategies for large e-commerce sites

**Speaker: [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), Principal Developer Experience Engineer, Netlify**

One of the reasons Jamstack is so popular is how well it delivers performance benefits at scale. But if you’ve got a massive site and are putting hundreds of thousands of assets through a sequential build process, things start to get a little dicey. The pre-rendering step becomes a bottleneck, leaving development teams waiting around for builds to complete. Ultimately, this slows down the speed of iteration—and nobody wants that.

So, how can developers with huge sites get around long build times?

In this talk, Cassidy Williams will cover different caching strategies to improve long build times, including serverless, edge personalization, and some tips on the best ways to get the benefits of the Jamstack with Next.js.
