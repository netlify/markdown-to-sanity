  You can configure redirects and rewrite rules for your Netlify site by adding
  a _redirects file to the root of your site folder (note, if you’re running a
  build command, the _redirects file should end up in the folder you’re
  deploying. It’s not enough to have on in the root of your repository).

You can configure redirects and rewrite rules for your Netlify site by adding a`_redirects`file to the root of your site folder \(note, if you’re running a build command, the`_redirects`file should end up in the folder you’re deploying. It’s not enough to have on in the root of your repository\).

To learn more about what you can do with the _redirects file read our
[documentation on the subject](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) and
