[Jake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) and [Surma](https://twitter.com/dassurma) recently [gave an incredible talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTt7Tja30Q) at [JAMstackConf](https://jamstackconf.com/sf/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=jamstack-podcasts-swyx&utm_campaign=devex) taking a standard JS app and adding running the gamut of web performance best practices, from adding static render, to massively improving the time to first render, and time to interactive. Their chemistry was no surprise to fans of [their podcast](https://developers.google.com/web/shows/http203/podcast) (it's also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAKIQFsNbV0JDws_G_bnNo9)!), which hilariously references an obscure status code for [Non-Authoritative Information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/203)!

In the words of Wes Bos, "[don't listen to them](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1178738370945703948)"?
