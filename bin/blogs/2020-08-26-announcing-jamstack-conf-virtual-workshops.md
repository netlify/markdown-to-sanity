In May we welcomed over 8,500 attendees live for the first virtual Jamstack Conf. We are gearing up for another fantastic event in October with even more Jamstack community and content. Today, we’re excited to announce the first workshops available.

Workshops will take place on Wednesday, Oct 7. Each workshop is 4 hours and limited to 40 seats.

**[Purchase workshops and register](https://ti.to/netlify/jamstack_virtual_oct)** for Jamstack Conf today! 

Here's more information about some of the workshops.

#### Getting started with GatsbyJS - Monica Powell

In this workshop, Monica Powell will cover the fundamentals of developing fast, accessible sites with Gatsby, a React framework, and dive deep into the building blocks you’ll need to build your own custom Gatsby sites.

After completing a mix of lectures and exercises you’ll be able to build a Gatsby site from the ground up and deploy it live. In particular, you’ll learn the ins and outs of creating Gatsby sites, from selecting a starter or theme, using GraphQL to generate the data layer, making Markdown content interactive with MDX, deploying your site, and more!

This workshop is for JavaScript developers who haven't had extensive experience with Gatsby and want a deeper understanding of Gatsby.

#### Building Modern APIs with GraphQ - Eve Porcello, Moon Highway

Do you know where your data is? Is it in databases? Is it available via REST APIs? Is it found in cloud services? Is it in all of those places? Does that feel slightly stressful? Luckily, GraphQL is here to help. GraphQL provides us with a great way to organize our many different data sources and get just the data we want.

In this workshop, we’ll create our own GraphQL API with Apollo Server that orchestrates a variety of data sources. We’ll learn to deploy our application and will introduce you to a graph of GraphQL tools and features to put everything in context. Along the way, we’ll learn best practices for scalable API design that can be applied to any GraphQL project.

This workshop is for anyone who wants to learn more about GraphQL as a technology and how it fits into the larger Jamstack ecosystem. Even if your job role does not call for you to build GraphQL APIs every day, this course will give you what you need to query GraphQL APIs and collaborate on GraphQL projects.

#### Better Build a Build Plugin - Tara Z. Manicsic, Netlify

At the last Jamstack Conf we announced Netlify Build Plugins. We’re excited to offer devs a way to create custom build functionalities and a one-click install method for all devs and Netlify users to add them to their build process. In this workshop, we’ll create Build Plugins of our own. We’ll cover all the tools we make available to customize the build process and touch on the many different possibilities that help automate processes for you and your users.

#### Jamstack 101 and Beyond with Netlify - Jason Lengstorf, Netlify

This workshop will discuss the key benefits of using a Jamstack approach to web architecture. We'll explore the core principles and attributes, and look at some examples. Then we'll take a practical tour around some of the features and workflows which Netlify offers to enable these attributes of the Jamstack to your projects. Including:

* Ways to deploy your sites to Netlify- Creating CI/CD workflows
* Environments, previews, rollbacks- Optimising sites with post-processing
* Capturing user input with forms and functions
* Hooks, notifications and leveraging APIs
* Ways to gradually migrate to the Jamstack
