## üîó Linkable log = better team collab

![Netlify Linkable Logs](/v3/img/blog/linkable-logs-newsletter.png)

You can now create a shareable URL for a single deploy log line or range of lines, making it super easy to reference and share with team members. This handy feature was created in our company-wide hack day, because we build Netlify on Netlify, and are passionate about developer experience. ‚ú® [Check out the docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#share-log-content).

Bonus: you can now pause and play Functions logs, making for a better debugging experience all around!

## üìò How Spring Migrated from a Monolith to Microservices

![](/v3/img/blog/spring_case_study.png)

Spring (formerly Teespring) is a massive e-commerce platform with more than 1 million unique visitors each day. They migrated from a monolithic Rails app to a microservices-based web architecture, and achieved vastly better developer experience, site performance and conversion rates. They also cut build times from 90 minutes to 1 minute using Netlify High-Performance Build.
