For Google I/O 2019, the Google Chrome Labs team designed and built a game using web technologies. The game, [Proxx](https://proxx.app) is heavily inspired by Minesweeper, the old classic many of us will remember from Windows back in the _(choose a decade and show your age)_.

Proxx is an exploration (by the same team at Google who built [Squoosh.app](/blog/2019/01/09/featured-site-squoosh.app/), also hosted by Netlify) into building interactive, dynamic, and performant applications with web technologies. It is a super example of optimizing for performance without sacrificing capabilities, and has wonderfully broad compatibility.

Proxx makes use of technologies like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for components and bundling, [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) for thread management, and [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for rendering.

Google have made [the source code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/proxx) open source, and available as an excellent learning resource.

The app is being featured and discussed as part of a session called [Build Fast and Smooth Web Apps from Feature Phone to Desktop](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/edd25f87-df45-4b17-84c8-2037ab1b6bae) at Google I/O.
