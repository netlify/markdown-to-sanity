We had an awesome conversation with Adam Stacoviak and Jarrod Santo on the hugely popular [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) podcast talking about JAMstack, Netlify, and Netlify CMS. We discuss how open source drives standards and speak about how we helped [Smashing Magazine improve speed](/blog/2017/03/16/smashing-magazine-just-got-10x-faster/) by 10x.
