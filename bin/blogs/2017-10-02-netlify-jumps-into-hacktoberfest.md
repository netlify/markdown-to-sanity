This year Netlify is getting involved in Hacktoberfest, the annual  event designed encourage participation in open source projects.

According to Github, [last year's Hacktoberfest](https://blog.digitalocean.com/open-source-at-its-hacktoberbest/) had contributors from over 100 countries who submitted over 90,000 pull requests to open source projects.

That’s amazing, right? Well, let’s make this year even bigger.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a  October [web event](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) organized by Digital Ocean in partnership with GitHub where open source project maintainers make it easy for developers participate in  open source projects.

If you open four pull requests marked Hacktoberfest between October 1-31, you’ll receive a commemorative t-shirt as a special thank you.

And you’re helping some awesome projects!

## Netlify CMS \+ Hacktoberfest

In anticipation of the 1.0 release of Netlify CMS in early December, our community has been hard at work opening and organizing issues (and, you know, actually building features and squashing bugs).

 We’ve added the [Hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues?q=is%3Aopen\+is%3Aissue\+label%3Ahacktoberfest) to a variety of issues that could use a hand.

*Here are a few examples:*

* Add JSON(other) to the readable config formats [\[ISSUE 283\]](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/283)
* Prompt to save unsaved changes on browser close [\[ISSUE 286\]](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/286)
* Entries with .markdown extension don't work[ \[ISSUE 317\]](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/317)

[\[See more \]](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues?q=is%3Aopen\+is%3Aissue\+label%3Ahacktoberfest)

We appreciate any help and know all the open source projects participating would as well!

If you’d like to get more involved with Netlify CMS, you can join our biweekly, public [meetings](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/netlify-cms-planning-session-bi-weekly-tickets-35794058994) where we  talk about [the progress](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/09/28/netlify-cms-planning-working-in-sprints/) and priorities. We  have a pretty rad [Gitter community too](https://gitter.im/netlify/NetlifyCMS)!

Thanks for reading and **Happy Hacking!**
