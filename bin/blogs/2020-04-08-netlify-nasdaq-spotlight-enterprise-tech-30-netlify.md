From the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, video series host Josh Machiz, Chief Digital Officer of Nasdaq, speaks with our co-founders Matt Biilmann and Chris Bach.

As discussed in our initial [Enterprise 30 announcement](https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-named-to-2020-enterprise-tech-30-list/), Netlify was launched in 2015 and has been funded by Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, as well as the founders of Figma, GitHub, Heroku, Slack and Yelp.

In this Nasdaq video series, co-founders Matt and Chris describe the [Jamstack architecture](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/), pioneered by Netlify, and go over the various advantages that [using Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) for your modern web properties brings.

Onboarding more than 800,000 developers, Netlify is one of the fastest growing web development platforms. What makes Netlify different from CDN or cloud providers is that it [provides a single workflow](https://www.netlify.com/products/) to manage the CI/CD build pipeline, continuous deployment, and hosting infrastructure all in one platform.

Throughout this video learn more about the story and backgrounds of Netlify's founders, as well as a discussion around our recent announcement of [a new round of $53M in Series C funding](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/04/netlify-secures-series-c-funding-to-push-forward-our-vision-for-the-web/) led by EQT Ventures, and with participation from existing investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and Preston-Werner Ventures.
