2020\. Wow. It really goes without saying that this has been an extremely challenging year for everybody globally. Writing this article [last year](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/12/19/top-15-from-2019-features-resources-and-news-on-netlify-and-the-jamstack/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) was a different experience.

It's our hope that you find yourselves doing well. As the entire world has turned towards the web more than ever this year, we at Netlify have found solace in doubling-down on our mission.

This article recalls 10 features and announcements that we’ve made this year in a continued effort to positively impact how developers and businesses build for the web. From opening up our Build layer, to third party plugins, to advancing serverless functions, on through to driving innovation and personalization at the Edge. Our goal at Netlify has been to make it possible to run complex and dynamic web projects on the Jamstack with the developer experience that you expect from Netlify.

So, let’s again reflect on the past, and look forward to the future!

## Top 10 Netlify features in 2020

![featured image](/v3/img/blog/netlify-year-in-review-2020-top-10-features.jpg)

**1. [Build Plugins General Availability Announcement](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/27/netlify-build-plugins-are-here/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

In May, we announced the [GA of Build Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/27/netlify-build-plugins-are-here/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) - this allows you to customize your build process and automate build tasks with one click from the UI. Both the developer community and [technology partners](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/07/tech-partners-create-custom-build-plugins-to-reach-developers-in-their-workflow/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) like Algolia, Nimbella, and Snyk have helped advance this ecosystem in the time since launch.

**2. [Next.js on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/12/07/announcing-one-click-install-next.js-build-plugin-on-netlify/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

Announced earlier this month, the `next-on-netlify` Build Plugin utilizes Netlify Functions for server-side rendering. Install it to begin using the features of Next.js that you know and love that typically only work on apps running a Node server. [Add the Next.js Netlify Plugin here](https://app.netlify.com/plugins/@netlify/plugin-nextjs/install?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020).

**3. [Introducing Background Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/29/announcing-background-functions/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

Full-stack Jamstack: [Background Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/29/announcing-background-functions/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) released in Beta for our [Pro plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) (and higher) customers allow you to set up serverless functions that can run asynchronously for up to 15 minutes. This increases performance immensely by offloading long-running functions, processing them behind-the-scenes.

**4. [Automatic Brotli Compression on Netlify Edge](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

Earlier in 2020 we were delighted to announce that assets delivered via Netlify Edge are now [automatically compressed with Brotli encoding](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020). No action needed, Netlify Edge is already encoding and caching suitable assets with Brotli, increasing performance for all.

**5. [Celebrating 1 Million Developers on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/08/03/celebrating-1-million-developers-whats-next-for-netlify-and-the-jamstack/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

Mid-year, we celebrated a big milestone: one million developers and businesses (_now 1.3 million!_) have signed up for Netlify! To celebrate, we created an interactive timeline to review [Netlify’s major milestones throughout the years](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/08/03/netlify-milestones-on-the-road-to-1-million-devs/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020). If you haven’t already, you can still [look up and share your unique "number" for joining Netlify](https://million-devs.netlify.com/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020).

Aligned with our mission and vision of advancing the web together, we were very excited to launch an official [Netlify Partner Program](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/08/26/global-agencies-are-teaming-up-with-netlify-for-jamstack-websites-and-web-apps/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020) that provides resources, official partnerships, and more to these agencies.

**7. [Netlify App Team Overview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/22/announcing-team-overview-collaborate-easier-develop-faster/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

During this year's second Jamstack Conf Virtual, we announced [early access to Edge Handlers](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/06/announcing-netlify-edge-handlers-now-in-early-access/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020). Edge Handlers are the first solution of its kind to combine edge compute with a Git-based workflow, making it easy for frontend developers to customize the network edge for a faster, more engaging web experience.

**9. [Self-Hosted GitHub and GitLab Repos](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/07/21/unlock-jamstack-for-enterprise-web-apps-with-self-hosted-git-repos/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020)**

Furthering improvements for the many enterprises on Netlify, we announced [Netlify's support for self-hosted instances of GitHub and GitLab](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/07/21/unlock-jamstack-for-enterprise-web-apps-with-self-hosted-git-repos/?utm_source=netlify-internal-links&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=netlify-year-in-review-2020).
