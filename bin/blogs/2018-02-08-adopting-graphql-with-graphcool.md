  In episode 25 of JAMstack Radio, Brian is joined by Johannes Schickling and
  Soren Bramer Schmidt, the co-founders of Graphcool, a GraphQL backend
  development framework. They discuss the evolution of GraphQL, the communities
  that surround it and its use in production.

In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I catch up with the Graphcool cofounders again to chat about their decision for open sourcing their framework for getting GraphQL into new and existing projects.
