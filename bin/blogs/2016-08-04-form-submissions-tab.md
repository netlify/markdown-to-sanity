See the submissions for your backend-less forms directly on Netlify.

Did you know that Netlify can [handle form submissions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling) for you without requiring complicated backends? Every site in a [paid or Open Source plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing) can take advantage of this feature!

To be honest, it's a great feature that has always been slightly hidden from everyone. So, we decided to give it more visibility.
After [creating a new form](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling), you'll be able to access all the submissions you receive directly in the new Forms tab.

But to take full advantage of form submissions, use our [webhooks and notifications](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks#outgoing-webhooks-and-notifications) to redirect them to Slack, an email address or any API you want to use to process them.
