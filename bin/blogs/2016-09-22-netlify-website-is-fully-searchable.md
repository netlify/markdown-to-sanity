Today, we deployed a change in Netlify's website to make it fully searchable.

Finding content in this blog and the documentation is just a few keystrokes away. Click in the search icon in the top navigation bar and start typing, the search will populate the most relevant content it finds. However, if you don't feel like using the mouse, just start typing, right now!
