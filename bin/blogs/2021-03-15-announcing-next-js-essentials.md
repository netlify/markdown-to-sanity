Chances are, if you've used Next.js on Netlify, you've encountered either the `next-on-netlify` npm package, or the Next.js Build Plugin to enable some of its Node-driven features.

Today, we're happy to announce that the two have become one, to form the **Essential Next.js Plugin**!

With this plugin, you enable features like:

* Support for `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` with fallbacks (via [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=functionsnext-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs))
* Preview Mode
* Internationalized Routing
* [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/03/08/incremental-static-regeneration-its-benefits-and-its-flaws/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=isrnext-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)
* and more!

And, that's not all, we now *auto-detect* when you use Next.js on Netlify, so **you don't have to manually install anything** to get all of the features you love in Next.js working on the platform. 

## What do I do next?

Ha! That's a pun.
What does this mean for you if you already use the old version of the plugin, or the `next-on-netlify` package? Technically, you don't have to do anything, this won't break your current projects. But, if you want to use the latest and greatest changes:

* You can go ahead and uninstall the package, and remove it from your netlify.toml.
* If you have a `next.config.json`, make sure to set `target: "serverless"`, but if you don't have anything else in that file, you can remove it.
* Install the new plugin either in the UI or [manually in your netlify.toml](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs#installation-and-configuration):

For a new site deployed with Next.js, Netlify will automatically install this plugin.

This means that **you don't have to do anything** â€” just build and deploy your site to Netlify as usual and we'll handle the rest.

If you'd like to learn more or get involved:

* [File any issues you see on the plugin repo](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs), or make a PR if you see improvements that can be made!
