This elegant campaign site from Nike is deployed and hosted as a JAMstack site with Netlify. Its content management is decoupled from the frontend and drawn from a [headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org) at build time (in this case, [Dato CMS](https://www.datocms.com/)), and has a frontend developed using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
