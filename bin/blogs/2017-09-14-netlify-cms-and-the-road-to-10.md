It’s been exciting to see our open source project Netlify CMS grow from just a few developers to a project with just under 3,000 stars on GitHub and over 45 contributors.

We still have still a long road ahead and we look forward to sharing what our [Road to 1.0](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/milestone/1) looks like—success, mishaps and all.

*We’d like to invite you to join us!*

Check out our bi-weekly [planning sessions](https://www.netlifycms.org/community/)  to see our progress throughout the road to 1.0. Or [jump in on Gitter](https://gitter.im/netlify/NetlifyCMS) and get to know the Netlify CMS maintainers and ask any questions you may have.

## What is Netlify CMS?

Netlify CMS is a Content Management System for static sites, allowing collaborators to create, edit, review, and publish content without writing code or dealing with version control. It brings the ease of WordPress-style editing to the simplicity and speed of static sites.

At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub API.

## The Road to 1.0

We’ve set the 1.0 release for early December and there’s a lot of work to be done!

We’ve built a [milestone](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/milestone/1)  for 1.0 and have adopted two week sprints on a [project board](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/projects) to make the workflow clearer and easier for contributors to follow.

A few of the product details we want to make sure are being touched in 1.0:

* Media UI Library (see issue [#350](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/350))
* Various design improvements (see issues [#490](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/490), [#179,](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/179) &[ #180](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/180))
* Documentation improvements (see issue[ #598](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/598))

## Contributions

An open source project would be nothing without [amazing contributors](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms#contributors). We appreciate you all so immensely and look forward to adding more faces to this group.

We recently started using Kent C. Dodds’s [All Contributors project](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) to represent all contributors, not just the ones who push code. If *you*’ve made a contribution—written a tutorial, shared an example site, or done [any of these activities](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key) that help the users and developers of Netlify CMS—submit a pull request to add yourself to the list!
