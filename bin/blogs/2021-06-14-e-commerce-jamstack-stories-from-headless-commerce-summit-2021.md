Headless commerce has all sorts of business advantages. Of course we want better customer experiences and improved performance. But without the right team workflows and adoption strategies, getting the benefits of headless commerce is easier said than done. In this keynote, Netlify co-founder Chris Bach helps us rethink team adoption of Jamstack architecture, walking through simple, incremental migration strategies on the Jamstack, and how to improve developer workflows and boost productivity with headless architecture.

## Manscapedâ€™s Scaling Story: a D2C Migration from Monolithic Shopify to Jamstack

Presenters: Preston Straight and Alex Luong, Manscaped

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqQF9NA4hwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Until 2019, D2C company Manscaped was fully built on the Shopify stack. But as they grew into different markets and internationalized their website, they realized this wouldnâ€™t scale. Copying and pasting their theme compounded any errors, and made it challenging to make even minor updates--a must-have in D2C. They decided to migrate to the Jamstack. In this talk, engineers Preston Straight and Alex Luong talk about why they chose the Jamstack approach, and how it affected site performance, scalability, and internationalizing their sites.

ComplexLand is a 3D e-commerce-enabled video game where users can shop from over 60 brands. The free, immersive virtual experience was built with a tight timeframe using Jamstack.
