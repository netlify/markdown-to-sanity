  In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Ryan Scott Brown and
  David Wells to examine the rise of Functions as a Service (FaaS).

---
In the latest JAMstack Radio we discuss common use cases for FaaS and break down the cost benefit of using a service like Lambda instead of a more traditional server. Ryan Scott Brown also discusses the main players in the space with me and some of the vendor lock-ins you should expect across the spectrum when using FaaS.
