On the latest [React Roundup](https://devchat.tv/react-round-up/) episode, Justin Bennett and Chris Anderson talk about the origins of FaunaDB and how it works swimmingly with the JAMstack.

> My favorite thing about JAMstack is that it's all these best practices coming together... whether I'm working with Enterprise engineers who invented these best practices or people coming out of a code school **they all understand the value of having a well defined build step for your application** and having all that automated by a service like Netlify and having that separation of concerns between your compiled application deliverable and the APIs that it depends on.

We've written before about [Building Serverless CRUD apps with Netlify Functions & FaunaDB](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/09/building-serverless-crud-apps-with-netlify-functions--faunadb/), and you can check out [the Fauna Demo Readme](https://github.com/fauna/netlify-faunadb-todomvc) and [try our updated demo here](https://github.com/sw-yx/netlify-fauna-todo)!
