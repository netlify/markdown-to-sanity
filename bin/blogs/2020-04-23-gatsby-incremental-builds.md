Gatsby recently released [incremental builds](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/page-build-optimizations-for-incremental-data-changes/), an improvement that reduces the amount of work required to build a Gatsby site. In this post, weâ€™ll learn **how to enable Gatsby incremental builds on Netlify.**

## Step 1: Upgrade to Gatsby v2.20.4 or higher

Gatsby introduced incremental builds in version 2.20.4, so make sure to upgrade your Gatsby site to the latest version.

```bash
# this will upgrade to the latest version of Gatsby
npm install gatsby@latest
```

## Step 2: Install cross-env

Most Windows command prompts will choke when you set environment variables as part of your build command. Cross-env will let us not worry about what environment we are using.

```bash
npm install cross-env
```

## Step 3: Add the Gatsby Cache Netlify Build Plugin

Incremental builds rely on Gatsbyâ€™s cache, so we need to enable `netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache`, which will persist Gatsbyâ€™s `public` and `.cache` directories between builds.

You can use this [one-click installation link](http://app.netlify.com/plugins/netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache/install) for the Netlify UI, or you can read up on [file-based Build Plugin installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation) in our docs.


## Step 4: Add the flag to enable Gatsby incremental builds

Finally, update your build command in `package.json` (or wherever youâ€™ve set your build command) to include the incremental builds flag:

```diff-json
    "scripts": {
      "develop": "gatsby develop",
-     "build": "gatsby build"
+     "build": "cross-env GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_PAGE_BUILD_ON_DATA_CHANGES=true gatsby build --log-pages"
    },
```

Weâ€™re adding the optional `--log-pages` flag here so we can see what Gatsby builds on each runÂ â€” feel free to leave that out if you donâ€™t want to see the extra logs.

## Step 5: Make a change in your CMS and see the incremental builds!

Once weâ€™ve made the above changes, our Gatsby site will run with incremental builds enabled! This means that changes from a supported CMS â€” Gatsby supports Contentful, Sanity, DatoCMS and CosmicJS at the time of writing with WordPress and Drupal support in alpha â€” Gatsby will only rebuild the parts of the site affected by the changed data.

If we look at our build logs, the first build will show a full build with all of our pages:

```text
2:00:43 PM: info Done building in 41.429647017 sec
2:00:43 PM: info Built pages:
2:00:43 PM: Updated page: /design-research-program
2:00:43 PM: Updated page: /offline-plugin-app-shell-fallback/
2:00:43 PM: Updated page: /
2:00:43 PM: Updated page: /404/
2:00:43 PM: Updated page: /404.html
```

On repeat builds, we can see that the Gatsby build is _much_ faster and only rebuilds the page that was changed:

```text
2:03:56 PM: info Done building in 17.691847403 sec
2:03:56 PM: info Built pages:
2:03:56 PM: Updated page: /design-research-program
```

## You can use Gatsby incremental builds today!

If youâ€™ve got a Gatsby site, you can enable incremental builds today!

Give it a try, and enjoy builds that make your blazing fast Gatsby site even more blazinger! ðŸ”¥
