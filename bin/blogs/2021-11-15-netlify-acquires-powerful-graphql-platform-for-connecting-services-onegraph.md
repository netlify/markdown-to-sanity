Today we’re thrilled to announce that Y Combinator and SignalFire-backed OneGraph is joining Netlify, driving innovation in the Netlify platform to make it even easier to compose apps with APIs and services.

We launched Netlify in 2015 to help developers move from legacy monolithic web architecture to Jamstack, where the web presentation layer is decoupled from backend logic. Over the years we’ve helped address the complexities of this transition, bringing together the developer tools and services that make up this new web stack into a streamlined Git-based workflow—and making it easier for developers to build, run and scale the world’s best web sites, e-commerce stores and apps.

As we’ve worked with development teams to move web properties to this new modern architecture, you’ve told us that it continues to be challenging to connect and work with APIs and third-party services from your web applications. From figuring out API structure, to reading between the lines of third-party API docs, to authentication. This is what makes OneGraph such a perfect fit for Netlify. OneGraph will drive innovation in the Netlify platform to make it even easier to build and manage integrations across third-party services as well as access to your own internal services and data. OneGraph uses GraphQL as a modern standard for connecting these services, using great tooling that’s fast, extensible, and reliable. 

We’re excited for a future where developers have a unified way to access the APIs and services they choose on Netlify. To fuel innovation and fulfill this vision, OneGraph’s co-founders Sean Grove and Daniel Woelfel will be leading API ecosystem strategy here at Netlify and an integral part of the engineering team. I have been excited about this opportunity for a while now and from the first time I met Sean at a Jamstack meetup several years ago, I've been impressed with his strong technical vision and his ambition to bring together all the world’s APIs within one united graph. Together we’ll be able to pursue this vision even better and work together with our extensive ecosystem partners to enable the broader goal of API federation via GraphQL for the modern web.

## A first step: Try out API Authentication 

While fully integrating OneGraph into Netlify will take some time, we’re excited to announce the first step in making multi-app service integrations easier - officially launching [API Authentication](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/11/17/first-look-announcing-api-authentication-on-netlify/), through Netlify Labs. With one-click in the Netlify UI, you can now generate and manage authentication tokens for a catalog of third-party APIs. The feature is available to all Netlify users from the Netlify Labs dashboard.

We're excited to welcome the OneGraph team to Netlify and we think you’ll love the capabilities this will unlock on the Netlify platform.
