GraphQL is an open source query language from Facebook to connect APIs to Frontend applications. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

[Graphcool](https://graph.cool) is a project that provides a flexible backend platform combining GraphQL\+ AWS Lambda. The nice part about is how quickly you can get a project up and running.

I  recommend checking out their  getting started video, it is well worth the 5 minutes you will spend on it. Their recommendation is to download their example project to add your Graphcool API URL, but we went one step further to provide a one click deploy button to Netlify.

Click the button and provide your URL to Netlify to have see your GraphQL connect site ready to go and try out.

<div class="flex-centered">
  <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/bdougie/react-relay-instagram-example">

  </a>
</div>

Our button will clone a React and Relay application, if you are not familiar with Relay, check out [learnrelay.org](https://learnrelay.org) —[ ](https://learnrelay.org)a site hosted with our [Open Source](https://netlify.com/open-source) plan.
