Have you ever felt like you werenâ€™t sure if your boss really knew how productive you were? What if you could somehow automate this troublesome task? Have no fear! In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to text your boss every time your site deploys so they know youâ€™re busy working! 

Weâ€™ll walk through how to set this up with the brand new [Netlify Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=twilio-plugin-sd&utm_campaign=devex), starting with the very basics of how it works. Weâ€™ll go through a basic implementation using Twilio and some environment variables to text someone after a deploy has completed. Letâ€™s get started!

## What is a build plugin?

A Netlify Build Plugin allows you to write custom scripts that are invoked at particular points when Netlify is building and deploying your site. Whatâ€™s nice about them is that they are just a regular JavaScript object, so the usage is fairly straightforward.

There are a number of events available:

* `onInit`: when the build starts
* `onPreBuild`: runs directly before building the functions and running the build commands
* `onBuild`: when the build commands are executing
* `onPostBuild`: after build commands are executed
* `onSuccess`: runs on build success
* `onError`: runs on build error
* `onEnd`: build finished, site deployed ðŸš€

This can help automate workflows and tasks, manage notifications, and kick off events that can have a ton of different purposes! You can use whatâ€™s available from others in the community, share yours, or create your own. The skyâ€™s the limit to what you can create, making your builds flexible to incorporate so much innovation. 

> ðŸŽ‰ Build Plugins are now open for everyone to use! Look for the Build Plugin menu at the top of your team and site pages.

## Writing a Build Plugin

If you look at the list above, you can imagine for a lot of scenarios, weâ€™ll hook into `onInit`, or `onEnd`, depending on what weâ€™re building. The simplest possible implementation would go like this:

```js
function netlifyPlugin(conf) {
  return {
    // Hook into lifecycle
    onEnd: () => {
      console.log("site build finished, site deployed! ðŸš€")
    }
  }
}

module.exports = netlifyPlugin
```

Every plugin should also have a `manifest.yml` file that holds information about the plugin. The plugin above would just need to include the name of the plugin in this file:

```yaml

# manifest.yml

name: netliy-plugin-my-first-plugin
```

Then, if you want to run it in a local folder to test it, in your Netlify config file add:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "./plugins/exampleplugin"
```

Your site directory would now look like this:

```
plugins
-- exampleplugin
---- index.js
---- package.json
-- src
---- index.html (or whatever your dev setup is)
netlify.toml
```

Here are a few examples including [Minify HTML](https://github.com/philhawksworth/netlify-plugin-minify-html), [Prerender SPA](https://github.com/shortdiv/netlify-plugin-prerender-spa), [Gatsby Cache](https://github.com/jlengstorf/netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache), [Checklinks](https://github.com/munter/netlify-plugin-checklinks), and more:
[https://github.com/netlify/plugins](https://github.com/netlify/plugins)

Or, if you want to enable many people to use it, you can publish the package to NPM, install it normally: `npm i netlify-plugin-examplename`, and then your Netlify config file would look like this:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-examplename"
```

## Writing our Simple Twilio Build Plugin

First, we want to install the Twilio package, and then require it in our plugins/netlify-plugin-twiliosms index file:

```bash
npm i twilio
```

In plugins/netlify-plugin-twiliosms/index.js:

```js
const Twilio = require("twilio")
```

Then we want to provide our plugin with our Account SID and Auth token. We donâ€™t want to  commit these to GitHub, so we create environment variables to use them in the project. We also want to get the Twilio testing phone number from the dashboard:

![Twilio dashboard](/v3/img/blog/twilio.jpg "Twilio dashboard")

And then login to netlify, go to my site, and add them in Settings > Deploys > Environment (or go to this URL and replace the site ID: `https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR-SITE-NAME/settings/deploys#environment`

* `ACCOUNT_SID` â€“ Your Account SID from www.twilio.com/console
* `AUTH_TOKEN` â€“ Your Auth Token from www.twilio.com/console
* `TO_NUM` â€“ The number you'll be texting, should be formatted like this: "+1650XXXXXXX"
* `FROM_NUM` â€“ The number you'll be texting from, must be a valid Twilio number, should be formatted like this: "+1650XXXXXXX"

You can see Iâ€™ve also added that I want to use the lifecycle trial here, though this will probably be removed in the future.

Now, Iâ€™ll add those environment variables to my index file, this is how I can access them: 

```js
const {
  env: {
    // Your Account SID from www.twilio.com/console
    ACCOUNT_SID,
    // Your Auth Token from www.twilio.com/console
    AUTH_TOKEN,
    // Text this number
    TO_NUM,
    // From a valid Twilio number
    FROM_NUM
  }
} = require('process')
```

Great! Now we can kick off the plugin, using the `onEnd` event. Weâ€™ll kick things off by passing our environment variables into the Twilio context:

```js
module.exports = {
  onEnd: async () => {
    console.log('Finish the build up, prepping to text!')

    const client = new Twilio(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN)
  }
}
```

Weâ€™ll add our message by giving it a body, and stating what number it goes to, and which it is from (this is your Twilio provided number).

```js
module.exports = {
  onEnd: async () => {
    console.log('Finish the build up, prepping to text!')

    const client = new Twilio(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN)

    const { sid } = await client.messages.create({
      body: 'Hi there, we just deployed the site successfully!',
      to: TO_NUM,
      from: FROM_NUM
    })
    console.log(sid)
  }
}
```

In this case, the `TO_NUM` is potentially the number of your boss. In my case, my boss is Netlifyâ€™s cofounder and as funny as this joke is I might not want to bother him too much ðŸ˜³So instead, Iâ€™ll use this opportunity to text my colleague, Phil Hawksworth! Iâ€™m sure he likes that.

## Using a Build Plugin

If youâ€™re not interested in writing a build plugin but rather, using someone elseâ€™s, you can install it via NPM. We would do this like so:

`npm i examplepluginname` or `yarn add examplepluginname`

And then make reference to it in our netlify config as we did earlier:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "example-plugin-name"
```

Or if we had options we needed to pass in we can include them with `plugins.inputs`:

```toml
[[plugins]]
package = "example-plugin-name"
  [plugins.inputs]  
    "tacos" = "pollo"
```

You'll want to enable Build Plugins for your site using the plugin, [check out the docs to learn how](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=twilio-plugin-sd&utm_campaign=devex#enable-build-plugins-beta).

## Wrapping up

Using Build Plugins to automate tasks can help us be more productive overall, and writing them can be an incredible amount of fun. (When I first started playing with them I wrote 3 in one night). 

You can check out [some of the plugins that have already been created](https://github.com/netlify/plugins) so far, or if youâ€™d like to write your own and open source it, let us know so we can check it out and perhaps feature you!
