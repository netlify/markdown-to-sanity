[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a fast, performant, and approachable JavaScript framework that seems to have caught the eye of a lot of individuals in the JavaScript community.

In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I chat with Jacob Schatz and Ben Mischenko (NetlifyCMS contributor). Jacob explains how he went about deciding on a JavaScript framework for GitLab and [what drew him to Vue.js](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/). He recalls his first project for evaluating Vue’s scalability and shares his thoughts on Vue’s strengths and limitations.
