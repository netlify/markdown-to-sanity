In light of the public health risks related to coronavirus (COVID-19), we have decided to transition [JAMstack Conf London, May 27-28](https://jamstackconf.com/) to an online event. We believe this is the best way forward for the global JAMstack community, and we are excited to bring everyone together virtually at the end of May!

JAMstack Conf is a celebration of the next generation of web apps, where the [JAMstack community](https://jamstack.org/community/) and ecosystem comes together to learn, connect and create. We received more than 100 CFP submissions for the London event, dozens of interested sponsors and were expecting 800 attendees. While we’re disappointed to miss each other in-person, we are confident we can channel this energy and enthusiasm into an online event that’s more accessible for our global community members.

JAMstack Conf London registrants will receive a refund for their ticket and we will open registration for the virtual event in the next few weeks. Please stay tuned for more updates on the event format, schedule and speakers as we transition our plans. We’ll also have a revised sponsorship prospectus ready soon.

We are still planning to host JAMstack Conf San Francisco as an in-person event, October 6-7, 2020. Share your interest in this event later this year by filling out an [early interest form for Jamstack Conf SF](https://forms.gle/7ZviY4DsUx6Xi2M79) to receive updates as we get closer.

Currently sponsoring or interested in sponsoring the virtual event in May and discussing options? [Contact us](https://forms.gle/EuKgTKeiGrftgfo89).

We are all very excited for JAMstack Conf—we hope to see everyone online in May, happy, healthy and ready to JAM!
