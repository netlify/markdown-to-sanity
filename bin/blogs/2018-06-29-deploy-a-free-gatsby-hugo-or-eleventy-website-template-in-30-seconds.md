Whether you are kicking off a new web project or just want to explore a new static site generator like Hugo, Gatsby, or Eleventy, you shouldn’t have to start from scratch.  Shouldn’t you be able to quickly bootstrap a project, link it to a new Git repository, and deploy it? Oh, and bonus points if you can set up continuous deployment, HTTPS and a custom domain in the same workflow?

Yep. We think so. That’s why we’ve started a collection of quick-start project [templates](https://templates.netlify.com/tags/serverless).

## What’s inside Netlify’s free website templates?

The central requirement for each of Netlify’s website templates is that you can kick off a project with a single click. Each template is a Git repository that you can clone and use either as a starting point for your own project, or as a chance to explore and learn about an particular framework, feature, technology or pattern.

Different projects and developers have different requirements, so you’ll find a variety of templates here. Some include a little HTML and CSS styling. Some are bare bones. The current selection includes:

* [GatsbyJS blog template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/gatsby-starter-blog/)
* [Hugo blog template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/hugo-starter-blog-theme-kaldi/)
* [Eleventy blog template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-base-blog/)
* [A site built with Hugo and managed by Netlify CMS](https://templates.netlify.com/template/hugo-starter-blog-theme-kaldi/)
* [A Gulp build pipeline for your JavaScript, Sass, Images, and any SSG](http://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-starter-with-functions/)
* [A serverless function workflow for AWS Lambda](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-starter-with-functions/)
* And more

## How do I use a template?

Click the Deploy to Netlify button.

That’s it. You’re done.

![An example of a Deploy to Netlify button](/v3/img/blog/dtn-button.png)


A Deploy to Netlify button is a pointer to a repository. When you click one, it:

* Clones the template repo into your own GitHub account (after asking for your permission)
* Creates a new site project in Netlify for you and links it to your new repo
* Installs all the dependencies
* Sets up continuous deployment, branch builds, preview builds and HTTPS
* Builds your site and deploys it to Netlify’s global CDN

That’s a production environment you just provisioned! With continuous deployment ready to deploy your changes whenever you push to your new Git repo.

## Where do I find templates?

Each template lives on its own page at [templates.netlify.com](https://templates.netlify.com) so that you can bookmark and share whichever templates you find useful.

We’ll continue to add more templates, tagging each one carefully so you can easily find what interests you, like [Gatsby](https://templates.netlify.com/tags/gatsby), [Hugo](https://templates.netlify.com/tags/hugo) or [Serverless](https://templates.netlify.com/tags/serverless).

## Can you contribute?

You certainly can.  We’ll curate the list quite carefully, but will gladly consider contributions. A well documented Git repo which successfully deploys to Netlify with [Deploy to Netlify button](https://www.netlify.com/docs/deploy-button/) is what you need.

You can read more about raising a pull request to contribute your own templates at [templates.netlify.com/contribute](https://templates.netlify.com/contribute)

## Ready to try one out?
