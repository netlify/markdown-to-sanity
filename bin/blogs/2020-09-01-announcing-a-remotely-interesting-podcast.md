That's right, the team at Netlify has started a new podcast and we're overly excited to share it with you today. [Remotely Interesting](https://remotelyinteresting.netlify.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=remotely-interesting-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) is a program covering the Jamstack, its ecosystem, surrounding technologies, and the goings-on of the community and its developers.

Check out our first episode with [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [Divya Tagtachian](https://twitter.com/shortdiv), [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), [Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth), [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), and [Tara Z. Manicsic](https://twitter.com/tzmanics). We discuss the naming changing choice from JAMstack to Jamstack, which Phil may or may not have been involved in. Then Divya leads us in a future-focused foray digging into the static-first future of the web. Finally, we wrap up the conversation looking at different frameworks, their highlights, and how similar they might be after all.
