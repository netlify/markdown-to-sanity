If you've ever built a file upload into your website, you might have come across the `multipart/form-data` encoding. It's the encoding browsers use for forms with file inputs in them, and it's also notoriously uncomfortable to work with.

Netlify gives you speedy access to [built in form handling](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/). But you
can also have your forms submit to serverless functions, which can be helpful when working with backend services.
This post will help you understand a related area of complexity: multi-part form data, and how to process it inside a [Netlify Function](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/).


## What's `multipart/form-data`, anyway?

Most forms are well-suited by the `urlencoded` encoding. You may have come across it, it's the one with where form fields are separated by `?` and `&`:

```jsx
?favourite_food=sushi&preorder_for=tonight&guests=4
```

This doesn't work well for file uploads though, since a file need some more context: The filename, its mime type and the actual contents.

If we add a file upload field to our form and change the encoding to `multipart/form-data` , this is how the payload looks:

```jsx
------WebKitFormBoundary8TPJmPk86DOKFN5a
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="favourite_food"

sushi
------WebKitFormBoundary8TPJmPk86DOKFN5a
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="preorder_for"

tonight
------WebKitFormBoundary8TPJmPk86DOKFN5a
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="guests"

4
------WebKitFormBoundary8TPJmPk86DOKFN5a
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="company_logo"; filename="some_logo.svg"
Content-Type: image/svg+xml

As you can see, every form field is transferred individually, separated by the `----WebKitFormBoundaryzt0ANlA4AJJAzE3w` boundary. You can also see that the part with our file contains some additional information: The filename and the file type! ðŸŽ‰

There's some performance considerations between `multipart/form-data` and `urlencoded` that are elaborated on [in this RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2388#section-5.2). Just know that generally, you should use `multipart/form-data` for forms with file inputs and `urlencoded` for everything else. 

## Parsing `multipart/form-data` inside a Netlify Function

While you certainly could build a parser for the above format yourself, this is the kind of task that's better left to a well-optimised library.

We like to use [busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy), which is a high-performance parser that's also used internally by popular Express package `multer`.

Here's a snippet that implements the parsing logic:

```jsx
import * as Busboy from "busboy"

function parseMultipartForm(event) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // we'll store all form fields inside of this
    const fields = {};

    // let's instantiate our busboy instance!
    const busboy = new Busboy({
      // it uses request headers
      // to extract the form boundary value (the ----WebKitFormBoundary thing)
      headers: event.headers
    });

    // before parsing anything, we need to set up some handlers.
    // whenever busboy comes across a file ...
    busboy.on(
      "file",
      (fieldname, filestream, filename, transferEncoding, mimeType) => {
        // ... we take a look at the file's data ...
        filestream.on("data", (data) => {
          // ... and write the file's name, type and content into `fields`.
          fields[fieldname] = {
            filename,
            type: mimeType,
            content: data,
          };
        });
      }
    );

    // whenever busboy comes across a normal field ...
    busboy.on("field", (fieldName, value) => {
      // ... we write its value into `fields`.
      fields[fieldName] = value;
    });

    // once busboy is finished, we resolve the promise with the resulted fields.
    busboy.on("finish", () => {
      resolve(fields)
    });

    // now that all handlers are set up, we can finally start processing our request!
    busboy.write(event.body);
  });
}
```

This snippet is not the easiest thing in the world, and if you don't get everything that's going on - no worries. This uses Node.js Streams, which is super fast (even when used outside of Netlify Functions), and that it returns a promise of your form values.

To use it, call it with your Netlify Function Event:

```js
// netlify/functions/restaurantReservationEndpoint
module.exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  const fields = await parseMultipartForm(event)

  fields.favourite_food // "sushi"  
  fields.company_logo   // { filename: "some_logo.svg", type: "image/svg+xml", content: Buffer([...]) }  
  ...
}
```

Now that you have the file, you can do whatever you want with it! Do image processing, write into a database, send it to another API ... the possibilities are endless.
