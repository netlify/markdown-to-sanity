## The Future of Commerce is Headless

Chris Bach, president and co-founder of Netlify, and Matt Biilmann, CEO and co-founder of Netlify, discuss why it's the time for headless and the modern commerce stack. We’re not talking about only improving e-commerce—we’re talking about *revolutionizing* it.

## Beyond the Shopify Storefront: Headless Commerce Considerations

Kelly Vaughn, CEO and founder, The Taproom, shares insights.

With the arrival of Shopify’s GraphQL API, headless commerce opened up a new realm of possibilities for Shopify merchants. It’s the best of both worlds: you can take advantage of the stability, security, and well-built architecture of Shopify’s admin while modernizing the storefront build experience. In this talk you’ll learn about the architectural and technical decisions developers face when building a headless commerce storefront on top of Shopify: from tooling and languages to common Shopify-specific “gotchas” that may present some difficulties.

## Fireside Chat: Developer Experience for Headless Commerce

Cassidy Williams, engineer at Netlify, is joined by Mark Stewart, CTO of Fostr, and discusses the best way to work with Jamstack and headless commerce, referencing brands like Victoria Beckham Beauty. They dive into dev tooling considerations and other questions like, why are luxury fashion and lifestyle brands so quick to pick up Jamstack? Mark notes that the visual presentation and performance are the most important to these brands. Milliseconds can improve conversion and this directly impacts sales. The Q&A dives into a deeper discussion.

This fireside chat video will be added soon, so check back!

## Scaling your eCommerce with Vue Storefront

Gift Egwuenu, frontend developer, Passionate People, discusses the key features of a Vue storefront.

Dive in to see more details on the architecture, core concepts, customizability, how to get started, and see a demo.

## ButcherBox’s Journey to Jamstack

Jeff Gnatek, head of engineering at [ButcherBox](https://www.butcherbox.com/), discusses how his team transitioned from a legacy web platform to a new engine that relied on separating the frontend and backend code. Their team did not need special servers, DevOps engineers or Kubernetes for this project. He discusses using a Jamstack architecture to separate parts of their site and build independently with Netlify, Contentful and Gatsby. Driven by page performance, they went from 4-7 seconds of load time, to under 1 second.
