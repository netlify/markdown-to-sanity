![Netlify Agency Partner Program](/v3/img/blog/blog-imag.png "Introducing Netlify Agency Partner Program")

Today we announce the **[Netlify Agency Partner](https://www.netlify.com/partners/agency/)** program.

This program is designed to help digital agencies build better web experiences and grow their practice with modern [Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) tools and workflows. Dozens of global agencies, consultancies, and integrators have already teamed up with Netlify to deliver transformative digital experiences to customers. Today we celebrate our early partners and are happy to invite more, talented agencies to join us!

## Partners and customers working with Netlify for sites that perform better

Netlify’s partners have already enabled their clients to *accelerate time to market* and *save money at scale* by moving critical web properties to the Jamstack. One example is with Therefore and customer [Longo’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh2GGhOXTzM).

> "As a high-end grocery company in Canada with customers that expect a first-class experience, we prioritized modern technology that could support our web-digital transformation goals. We worked with Therefore as our agency and Netlify’s Jamstack technology to deliver a better performing website and mobile experience. Running on Netlify, our website is more flexible and reliable, and performs three times faster than before." – Alicia Samuel, vice president of Information Technology, Longo’s

Proximity led Klépierre, a European leader in shopping centers, to deploy 98 sites in 6 months, while minimizing infrastructure costs and maximizing performance on Netlify.

> "We worked with our client, Klépierre, to build and scale their architecture across 98 sites. We decided to deliver a Jamstack model on Netlify as a means to better manage costs and mitigate risk on significant licensing from more traditional models. Our client is pleased that their sites load fast, and we were able to cut their costs significantly." – Jonathan Bobo, chief technology officer, Proximity

Additionally, Fostr worked with Netlify on [Victoria Beckham Beauty’s e-commerce store](https://www.netlify.com/resources/webinars/victoria-beckham-beauty-uses-contentful-and-netlify-to-build-a-dream-ecommerce-experience/). To create high-performing sites with a faster digital experience, they adopted a Jamstack approach with a decoupled architecture, integrating Netlify with services like Shopify Plus.

> "Victoria Beckham Beauty, a luxury clean beauty brand, engaged with us to create their online store. We wanted to create a high-performing site that offered us flexibility. We adopted a Jamstack approach with a decoupled architecture on Netlify, integrated with Contentful and services like Shopify Plus. With Netlify, our speed of development increased, and we were able to iterate more quickly and collaborate much more closely with our clients at Victoria Beckham Beauty." – Mark Stewart, chief technology officer, Fostr

## Agency Partner benefits: Jamstack expertise with Netlify

Netlify’s platform helps agencies achieve greater development productivity from the start through our platform’s seamless workflows. Teams can be more agile and responsive to change throughout the project, and can deliver performant, dynamic digital experiences on [Netlify’s multi-cloud edge network](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/).

Partners benefit from working with Netlify in the following ways:

* **Generate new business opportunities**: Agencies gain exposure and expertise in the growing Jamstack ecosystem by working alongside Netlify. Netlify is at the center of the modern web, and [more than one million developers and businesses](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/08/03/celebrating-1-million-developers-whats-next-for-netlify-and-the-jamstack/) have joined Netlify’s platform so far. Netlify collaborates directly with client-facing teams to provide resources and support during new business meetings and client engagements.
* **Increase development velocity and gain efficiencies**: Agencies can simplify web development and complete projects faster, while using tools and frameworks developers enjoy. Netlify removes the need to manage infrastructure for agencies and their clients, and agencies can manage multiple clients in one account.
* **Exceed client expectations**: Agencies can set new standards for performance, uptime, and cost-savings in every project by embracing the Jamstack web architecture and adopting the latest development best practices. Simplify cloud infrastructure management for you and clients.

We offer two agency partnership models. A *Netlify Agency Partnership* is for agencies that manage the Netlify experience for their customers–whether large or small. A *Global Alliance Partnership* is for agencies who wish to introduce Netlify to their enterprise customers. All Agency Partners are eligible for lead sharing, a dedicated account manager or access to the partner team, co-selling support, promotional opportunities, early access to new features, access to the Partner Hub and Slack, technical workshops, webinars, and more. Agencies interested in working with the Jamstack should apply. To join the program or learn more, just reach out to the [partner team](https://www.netlify.com/partners/agency/).

[Netlify recently announced](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/07/21/netlify-expands-pricing-options-more-value-for-developers-and-enterprise-teams/) an expansion to our plans. We now offer 3 team plans, ensuring your Netlify service can grow in capabilities as your business and client use-cases evolve. For agencies these plans make it easier for your developers to build better sites and work better with teammates in a more secure environment. We hope it lowers friction as agencies and their clients get started, and helps teams develop websites and apps even faster as you do more and more with the Jamstack. See our [team plans](https://www.netlify.com/pricing) for more information.

We have a few events in the coming weeks for agencies. Join the Jamstack for Agencies webinar to learn about Jamstack and the opportunities for your agency with Netlify. Attend the [Headless Commerce Summit](https://headlesscommercesummit.com/) to hear case studies from agencies about how Jamstack is pushing e-commerce forward. The Jamstack Conf Virtual is an event where the Jamstack community comes together to celebrate the next generation of the web. Check out and register your teams:
