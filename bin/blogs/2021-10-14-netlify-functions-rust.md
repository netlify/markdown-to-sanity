[Netlify Functions](/products/functions/) give developers an unrivalled workflow for building the backend of a web application, allowing them to focus on writing the business logic instead of provisioning servers, orchestrating deployments, or navigating verbose configuration.

With an integrated local development experience, itâ€™s possible to make changes to functions with a very short feedback loop, with compilation or build steps taken care of automatically behind the scenes. Developers can even generate a public URL for their local server, allowing colleagues or clients to follow along wherever they are in the world.

Currently, this complete experience is available for [JavaScript](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/), [TypeScript](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-typescript/), and [Go](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-go/) functions. Today, we're excited to announce experimental support for Rust in the Netlify Functions offering.

## Enabling the feature

During the experimental period, support for Rust must be enabled on a per-site basis by setting the `NETLIFY_EXPERIMENTAL_BUILD_RUST_SOURCE` environment variable to `true`. You can do this in the Netlify UI by going to **Site settings** > **Build & deploy** > **Environment**, or using the CLI:

```sh
netlify env:set NETLIFY_EXPERIMENTAL_BUILD_RUST_SOURCE true
```

## Creating a function

To create a new Rust function, you can run `cargo init FUNCTION_NAME` from your [configured functions directory](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/configure-and-deploy/#configure-the-functions-folder).

The name you choose for the function determines its endpoint. For example, running `cargo init hello` will create a function which, when deployed, will be accessible on the `/.netlify/functions/hello` endpoint.

Alternatively, you can get a jump-start with the [Netlify CLI](https://ntl.fyi/cli)'s function generator. Run `netlify functions:create --language=rust`, choose a template, and you'll get a fully working function, ready to be deployed and modified to fit your needs.

(You'll need Netlify CLI version 6.12.0 or later. Run `npm i -g netlify-cli` to install the latest.)

## Function structure

Every function must include a handler that receives requests and returns responses. This takes shape as a function using the `ApiGatewayProxyRequest` and `ApiGatewayProxyResponse` types from the `aws_lambda_events` crate.

Below is an example of a Rust function that returns a message saying "Hello world".

```rust
use aws_lambda_events::event::apigw::{ApiGatewayProxyRequest, ApiGatewayProxyResponse};
use aws_lambda_events::encodings::Body;
use http::header::HeaderMap;
use lambda_runtime::{handler_fn, Context, Error};
use log::LevelFilter;
use simple_logger::SimpleLogger;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    SimpleLogger::new().with_level(LevelFilter::Info).init().unwrap();

    let func = handler_fn(my_handler);
    lambda_runtime::run(func).await?;
    Ok(())
}

pub(crate) async fn my_handler(event: ApiGatewayProxyRequest, _ctx: Context) -> Result<ApiGatewayProxyResponse, Error> {
    let path = event.path.unwrap();

    let resp = ApiGatewayProxyResponse {
        status_code: 200,
        headers: HeaderMap::new(),
        multi_value_headers: HeaderMap::new(),
        body: Some(Body::Text("Hello world".to_owned())),
        is_base64_encoded: Some(false),
    };

    Ok(resp)
}
```

To try this function, you can clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/netlify/rust-functions-example), or deploy it directly to your Netlify account using the button below.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/rust-functions-example)

## Local development

You can use [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) to test your functions locally. Run `netlify dev` and open http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello in the browser. If you'd like to generate a public URL that is accessible from anywhere, use `netlify dev --live`.

Your function will be rebuilt automatically every time you change a file, so that you and your colleagues can see the changes immediately.

## Deployment

Once you're happy with your changes, you can commit and push the files to Git. We'll take care of building and deploying your functions automatically.

Our build system runs `cargo build --release` under the hood. If you'd like to customize the build pipeline, you can do so by [specifying a build command](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#basic-build-settings) that builds the functions and places the binaries in the configured functions directory. If you do that, make sure to use `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` as the build target.

Deploying a function for the first time may take a few minutes, since compiling a binary for release is a time-consuming process. But the build artefacts are cached between builds, so subsequent deploys should be significantly faster.

## Lab goggles required

This feature may change substantially while we fine-tune the implementation. Still, in the spirit of [involving our customers in the development of the product](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/03/31/test-drive-netlify-beta-features-with-netlify-labs/), weâ€™re excited to get it in front of _you_ sooner rather than later. Your feedback will help us create the best possible experience for everyone using Netlify.

Happy builds, fellow Rustaceans! ðŸ¦€ ðŸ¥½
