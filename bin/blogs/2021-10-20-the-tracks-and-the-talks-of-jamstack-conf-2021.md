Jamstack Conf was a huge, fun event full of launches, updates, and great knowledge sharing!

During the event we had a bit of a [power issue](https://patch.com/california/sananselmofairfax/wayward-bird-triggers-marin-power-outage-pg-e) but we made it through and can totally laugh about it now, right? Right, yeah, totally.

## The tracks

The two main tracks of the conference were "Jamstack Now & Next" and "Integrations & Tooling"!

The talks throughout "Jamstack Now & Next" were about exploring real-world executions and innovative techniques on the Jamstack to learn from their approaches and results, and also looking at emerging trends and developments.

The talks in the "Integrations & Tooling" track were all about tools and techniques from around the ecosystem, and how they can come together for amazing results.

We were supposed to have a "Learn with Jason" live track, but unfortunately the power had other plans. You can still [catch his track on October 25th and 27th](https://jamstackconf.com/learn-with-jason/), and watch Jason and several guests build a swag site with Shopify, Fauna, Algolia, Twilio, and Sentry!

## The talks

You can watch all the videos from each track over on [Jamstack TV, our community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8bRyfU7ycLXnEBfvdorpUg)!
