This is a re-publishing of our monthly newsletter sent to subscribers earlier this week. Sign up to receive future email newsletters!

{% renderFile './src/components/pages/blog/newsletter.vue' %}

It's been nearly a month since we got together at Jamstack Conf Virtual and introduced [Netlify Build Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/27/netlify-build-plugins-are-here/). In the June newsletter, you'll find many new resources and updates, including case studies from TunnelBear and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

But first, <strong>thank you for making your voices heard to condemn systemic racism and police violence against the Black community.</strong> Earlier this month, we asked for your donations to help aid groups that support the Black community, offering to match $25,000 USD. Together we were able to donate a combined $80,000 USD to organizations working to end racism and injustice. This is a small start that will require a much larger and sustained effort, and you can [continue to support these organizations here](https://www.netlify.com/donation-matching).

## Top 10 Netlify Build Plugins
​
On May 27, Netlify announced the general availability of Build Plugins, which allow you to customize your build process and automate build tasks with one click from the UI. New Build Plugins are becoming available daily, and you can also create your own Plugins to share with your team or the community.

Check out the [10 most-installed Build Plugins to date](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/06/22/top-10-netlify-build-plugins/) for a sampling of functionality you can add to your build process. You can also check out Sentry's [blog post detailing their plugin](https://blog.sentry.io/2020/06/08/automating-sentry-releases-with-our-netlify-build-plugin) that helps automate release management.

## Gain instant performance boosts as Brotli comes to Netlify Edge
​
We are delighted to announce that assets delivered by Netlify Edge [are now automatically compressed with Brotli encoding](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/) for even smaller asset sizes and decompression efficiency.

Brotli compression has gained widespread browser support and is particularly effective for text-based files such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS assets. The best news: you don’t need to take any action to start benefitting. Netlify Edge is already encoding and caching suitable assets with Brotli, and delivering correctly compressed assets depending on the requesting browser.
