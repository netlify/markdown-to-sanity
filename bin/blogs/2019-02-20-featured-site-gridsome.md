Gridsome is a static site generator which borrows many conventions and approaches from [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), but is built upon [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) rather than [React](https://reactjs.org/)

[Its site](https://gridsome.org/), deployed and hosted by Netlify, demonstrates some of its performance optimisations nicely, and includes search powered by Algolia.

It also articulates some of the benefits of a JAMstack architecture very well.

If you like the excellent development pipeline, templating, PWA helpers, and GraphQL support of Gatsby... but prefer Vue to React, Gridsome is worth watching.
