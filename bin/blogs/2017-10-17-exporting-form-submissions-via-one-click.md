Netlify’s [form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) (beta) allows you to add forms to your site without writing server-side code.You can see form submissions in our app, or download them as JSON via our API, but until now it was missing the basic functionality to export data as a CSV file. So, today we’re introducing the option to download form submissions in a single click.

## Download as CSV

To download your data as a CSV file, navigate to a particular form from within your dashboard and click **Download as CSV**.

It’s also way easier to see what’s going on in your individual forms now. We’ve added a summary card to the individual form pages, so you can see the number of submissions and the date and time of the last submission.
