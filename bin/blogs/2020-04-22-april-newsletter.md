## New SAML enforcement capabilities for business users

Single sign-on (SSO) is a fast and secure way for your team to access the Netlify UI. While SAML-based SSO has been available for a while as a part of our Advanced Team Security plan, we recently made an update that lets you restrict access to only team members who use SSO. Other login types such as email, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket will be denied access to the team unless they sign in via SSO. <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/accounts-and-billing/team-management/saml-single-sign-on/#get-started">Learn more in our docs</a>.

## Refined Name for Jamstack

JAMstack, JAMStack, or Jamstack? After an <a href="https://github.com/jamstack/jamstack.org/issues/279#issuecomment-607896059">in-depth conversation with the community</a> over the last month, we've come together to adopt "Jamstack" across jamstack.org. We'll start using that spelling in materials from Netlify and look forward to seeing it adopted by the wider community.

## Last call for your feedback for the Jamstack survey

Help the Jamstack community by giving us your feedback in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DHJSKF6">State of the Jamstack community survey</a>. When a community is growing this fast, it's hard to know what's standard practice and what's a niche interest. Tell us your Jamstack feedback and technology choices, so all can benefit from the results — newcomers and experienced users alike. The survey takes 15 minutes and is anonymous unless you want to be contacted. Survey closes April 26, and results will be shared during the Jamstack Conf virtual event.

## Automate your web workflows with the Jamstack

To highlight what makes the Jamstack so easily configurable compared to other frameworks for building sites, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/01/automate-your-web-workflows-with-the-jamstack/">check out</a> our recent examination of Build Automation, Event Triggers, APIs and Serverless Functions.

## Learn WordPress on the Jamstack in this demo

<a href="https://netlify.zoom.us/webinar/register/6915853373717/WN_hVvYQLy_Sd2YACOogtqM4w">Watch this demo</a> to learn how to migrate a WordPress website to the modern Jamstack architecture. While WordPress provides a pleasant content management experience, it can come with some development and site speed issues. Netlify's Jason Lengstorf goes step-by-step through turning your WordPress site into a Jamstack site with a WordPress backend. You can keep the convenience of using WordPress’s custom backend for creating and editing content while also avoiding the downsides of WordPress.

## Best practices: How to scope down pull requests

One of the most valuable skills one can possess as a developer is to learn how to scope down your work into manageable pull requests (PRs). <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/31/how-to-scope-down-prs/">Check out this recent post</a> from Sarah Drasner on the processes you can use to scope PRs down, as well as who on your team can assist.
