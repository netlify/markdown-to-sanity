Using Angular in your Jamstack architecture? Me too! I'm very excited that the #1, and only (*⸰‿-), static site generator for Angular, [Scully](http://scullyio.com/), has officially released their v1! I made a little video with some information and a few resources to boot. Hope you enjoy it.

As always, the Scully team would love your ideas, code, and feedback [in the Open Source repo for Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully). Here are the links to the resources listed in the video too. Hope this helps you on your way to coding some awesome Angular Jamstack projects. Happy coding ＼＿ﾍ(´ω｀)!
