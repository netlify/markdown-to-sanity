Today we shipped DNS Zones, a new way for you add whole DNS zones and manage DNS
records. We’ve also redesigned the Custom Domains card to make it easier for you
to get information about the domains associated with your site.

## Introducing DNS Zones

There's now a section called DNS Zones in the Netlify app that makes it easier to
manage your DNS configuration for multiple sites in the same domain.

A DNS zone contains all the DNS records for a domain. To see all of your DNS
zones on Netlify, navigate to your Account/Team root page, and click **DNS
zones**.

## A redesigned Domains card

In your site settings page, under Domains, you’ll find a redesigned Custom
Domains card that makes it easier to tell exactly which addresses are assigned
to your Netlify site. It also features more useful troubleshooting and
documentation for when something is _just not right_.

## Getting to know DNS

We know DNS is hard
([setting up custom domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/) is
our most visited docs page). The dedicated DNS Zones section is our first step
towards making DNS management more powerful, and easier to integrate into your
workflow. If you have questions or feedback about these changes, give us a shout
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/netlify),
