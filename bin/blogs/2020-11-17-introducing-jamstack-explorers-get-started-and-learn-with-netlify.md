[![Jamstack Explorers by Netlify](/img/blog/jamstack-explorers-netlify-blog-header.png "Jamstack Explorers community program")](https://explorers.netlify.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=intro-post-tzm&utm_campaign=devex)

Today we announce a few exciting updates for our Netlify community to make it even easier to get involved and learn more about the [Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/), an architecture that decouples the front and backend and supports new tools and workflows used in modern web development.

First, we welcome you to join us in our new Jamstack Explorers community program, an out-of-this-world learning platform to help you get more expertise in the Jamstack. Each mission is designed to allow you the flexibility to learn at your pace and track your progress. After completing three missions you even receive a certificate üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéìüéâ.

**[Go to mission control to sign up and get started with your exploration.](https://explorers.netlify.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=intro-post-tzm&utm_campaign=devex)**

Today brings our first phase of the community learning platform and we‚Äôre excited for you to get started whether you're new or experienced, learning on your own, or want to invite your team to have a simple and fun way to try out the Jamstack with Netlify.

If you‚Äôre an expert in Angular, Next.js, Nuxt.js, or Vue.js, this is a great way to learn about the advantages of the Jamstack architecture.

Maybe you see yourself as a Jamstack aficionado, yet want to dig deeper and expand your skills or brush up on some best practices. There's something for everybody, join the missions to get more advanced in the Jamstack.

We plan to add more missions and we look forward to your feedback as you advance through each checkpoint.
