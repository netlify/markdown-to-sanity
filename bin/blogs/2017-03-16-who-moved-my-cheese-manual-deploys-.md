Some things have changed with the [introduction of our brand new User Interface](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/14/introducing-a-new-design-system/)

One of those things is the way to trigger a Manual Deploy â€” here's how you do it:

## Manually Deploy to an existing site:

In the **Deploys** page, simply scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll see the target box( the box in which you can drag and drop your local project in) and immediately trigger a new build.

## Manually Deploy a new site:

Same as the above, but this time in the **Site**'s list!

Keep in mind: in order for this to work your project must have an index.html somewhere in the root.
