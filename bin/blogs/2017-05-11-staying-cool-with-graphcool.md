In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I invite Johannes Schickling to discussÂ [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), a flexible backend platform combining GraphQL & AWS Lambda.

Johannes recalls how he was first inspired to work on the Graphcool project. He reveals that unlike Parse and Firebase, Graphcool is based on open source technology and offers greater flexibility in the API layer along with tools to specify complex permission rules. Graphcool lets you stop wasting time writing error-prone database migrations and monitoring log files, letting you focus on what matters: building your app.
