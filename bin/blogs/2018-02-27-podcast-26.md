In this episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian and Ben are joined by Robert Moseley, Director of Social Engineering at Cloudinary, an end-to-end media management platform for developers. The group discusses just how much of the internet is images and videos, and poorly optimized ones at that, and how tools like Cloudinary can make major improvements behind the scenes.
