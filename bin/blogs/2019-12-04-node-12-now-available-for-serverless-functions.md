Last month AWS announced the release of Node.js 12 for Lambda functions.

This means faster functions & new Node.js features. ðŸŽ‰

Starting today, all new sites will be using Node.js 12 as the default function runtime. All existing sites can update to Node.js 12 for [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) via the instructions below.

## What's new?

Node.js 12 brings performance improvements and many [new language features](https://medium.com/@nodejs/introducing-node-js-12-76c41a1b3f3f). In tests like the one charted below ([source](https://medium.com/@ersun.warncke/benchmarking-node-js-v12-vs-v10-v8-v6-v4-and-go-89d28eee603d)), Node.js 12 is almost catching up to Go! ðŸ¤¯ Zoom zoom.

## How to upgrade existing site functions

To take advantage of the newer Node.js runtime with functions on sites created before December 4, 2019, you will need to set the `AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME` [environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/#runtime-settings) to `nodejs12.x` in the Netlify site settings under **Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables**.

After setting the environment variable, update your function code to trigger a new deployment.
