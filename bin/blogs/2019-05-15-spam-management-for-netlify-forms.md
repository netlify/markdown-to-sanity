Not long ago, we [improved Netlify Forms spam filtering using Akismet](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/12/improved-netlify-forms-spam-filtering-using-akismet/), which significantly enhanced our capability of detecting spam. But this has been a hidden power that you can’t manage. Wouldn’t it be lovely if you had more control?

## User interface additions

Without changing too much of the current UI, we introduced a dropdown menu to filter the submissions list by state (verified/spam) and a button to change the state of selected submissions.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEFHx-2A600" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We’ll keep iterating on the UI to add functionalities pragmatically. But for now, enjoy ~~spam~~!
