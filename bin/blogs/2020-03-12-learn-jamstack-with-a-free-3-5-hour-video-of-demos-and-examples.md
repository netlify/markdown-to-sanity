In the 5 years since the term "[JAMstack](/jamstack)" was coined by Netlify co-founders Matt Biilmann and Chris Bach, it has grown in popularity and gained increasingly broad adoption.

Although its core principles are simple, it is also a flexible and far-reaching approach to web development so there are sometimes misunderstandings about its fundamentals.

So, with the help of freeCodeCamp, I've put together an extended video to unpack some of the core principles of JAMstack, address some of the common misconceptions, and dive into some examples.

This 3.5 hour video begins with an explanation of the concepts and benefits of the JAMstack and progresses through a variety of examples which start very simple, and gradually build in complexity.

If you're not planning on making some popcorn and settling in for the full 3.5 hours in one sitting, you might want to dive directly in to one of the sections or examples.

Here's a breakdown of the video with some resource links to help you get to grips with the JAMstack:
