In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, I invite Vincent Voyer and Emily Hayman to discuss Algolia, a hosted search as a service.

Emily reveals that Algoliaâ€™s key differentiator is performance, both in terms of indexing and querying, as well as configurability. They also discuss Instant Search, an easy to use UI library for building a great search interface.
