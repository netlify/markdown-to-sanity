Are you building the next generation of web applications? [Register](https://ti.to/netlify/jamstack_virtual) to join us, May 27-28, for the biggest Jamstack Conf yet. We already have more than 6,000 Jamstack community members registered from 123 countries, and can’t wait to gather together online.

The full agenda is now available for [Jamstack Conf Virtual](https://jamstackconf.com/virtual/), the place for frontend and full stack developers to learn all things Jamstack, the modern web architecture. This special edition of Jamstack Conf will explore the current pandemic and the role of the web, in addition to case studies, demos, lightning launches and hands-on workshops.

The Jamstack Conf keynote speakers are not-to-miss:

* **Harper Reed**, a Jamstack pioneer and CTO of the Obama 2012 campaign, was the first to bring the tech mentality to a political level. There’s never a dull moment with Harper, and we’re here for the ride!
* **Erin Kissane**, highly respected author of "The Elements of Content Strategy," will share her insights from organizing widely cited Covid Tracking Project to discuss how this volunteer-led organization started building on the Jamstack and went from 0 to 1 million API requests in weeks.
* **Tom Preston-Werner**, co-founder of GitHub and most recently creator of RedwoodJS, will introduce his new open source serverless framework that inspires Jamstack’s viability for full stack applications.
* **Christian Nwamba**, senior dev advocate at Microsoft, will demonstrate how Jamstack sites enable performant connections over any network or device, especially in developing regions.
* **Matt Biilmann**, CEO of Netlify and Jamstack instigator, will talk about the role of the web and Jamstack in the current crisis, and why performance and accessibility are more important than ever.
* **Laurie Voss**, co-founder of npm and senior data analyst at Netlify, will share results of the most comprehensive Jamstack survey to date.
