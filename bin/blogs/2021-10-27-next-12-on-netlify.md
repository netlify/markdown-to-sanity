Yesterday Next.js 12 was released, and there are so many cool features coming out!

There's a new Rust compiler, which will make builds and refreshes nice and speedy, React 18 support, native ESM support, and a few other really neat things.

You can get started with a new Next.js 12 project here to try all of these projects out of the box!

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)

(Clicking this button will clone a starter repo to your Git provider of choice, and deploy it instantly to Netlify)

## Middleware support and the Edge

Out of the box, Netlify supports Middleware features with `next/server`! Middleware lets you run code before a request is completed. Based on the user's incoming request, you can modify the response they receive!

To use Next.js Middleware, if you're on the latest version of Next.js, create a `_middleware.js` or `_middleware.ts` file in your `pages/` directory. It will run on all routes within the `pages/` directory, similar to how `_app.js` works in wrapping all pages in that directory. Unlike `_app.js`, it can work on nested routes as well.

For example, let's say you want a page to show up differently based on a cookie in the user's request. You can use the `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` objects like so to rewrite the route:

```js
// pages/_middleware.js

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const someCookie = req.cookies['something']
  const res = NextResponse.rewrite(`/something/${someCookie}`)

  return res
}
```

As for geolocation, that requires access to [Edge Handlers](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/edge-handlers/), which is in beta.

## Native support out of the box on Netlify

[Next.js works out of the box on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/) with zero configuration thanks to our open source build plugin! The latest version of it is in beta, which you can read more about [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/25/preview-whats-new-with-next.js-on-netlify/).
