> Throughout December we'll be [highlighting a different Netlify feature each day](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/highlighting-a-different-netlify-feature-each-day-in-december/). ItÂ might just be the thing you need to unlock those creative juices, and [dust off that domain](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/dusty-domains-your-forgotten-domains-raise-money-for-charity/?utm_campaign=devex-ph&utm_source=netlify&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=adventure-cli-dev) you registered but never deployed! Keep an eye [on the blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/highlighting-a-different-netlify-feature-each-day-in-december/?utm_campaign=devex-ph&utm_source=netlify&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=adventure-cli-dev) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/netlify) for each feature!

Ok, Time to get productive!

[Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_campaign=devex-ph&utm_source=netlify&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=adventure-cli-dev) brings a variety of utilities to your local development environment, and even replicates some of Netlify's edge logic and routing rules available to you for testing and development.

Netlify Dev is available as part of the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli) which you can install globally on your system with:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Got that? Great! Lots of goodies await!

Now you can run `netlify dev` in your local project folder and it will automatically:

- Detect and run your site generator
- Serve your site locally
- Make environment variables available (More on those later this month!)
- Performs edge logic and routing rules (More on *those* later this month!)
- Compile and run serverless functions (And more on *those* later this month!)
- ...and more!
