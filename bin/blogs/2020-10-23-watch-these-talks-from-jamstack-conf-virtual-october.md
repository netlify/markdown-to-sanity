Jamstack Conf Virtual talks from October 6 are here! [Watch the recordings in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58Wk5g77lF94tg-F3y5zRyDeLVhTDnTg).

We had nearly 16,000 developers and web enthusiasts register to join us at the virtual conference for keynotes, interactive sessions, live Q&A and 1:1 networking--we enjoyed meeting you there! With 40% more registered than in our first virtual event in May, 48 speakers from the community, 28 sponsors, followed by nearly sold-out workshops on day 2, and the üéâ [inaugural Jammies award winners announced](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/10/06/announcing-the-jammies-awards-winners/), there is clearly a lot of interest and growth in this ecosystem.

New and seasoned Jamstack developers alike can learn and check out the latest ecosystem updates from our recorded event talks. Jamstack is a web architecture for faster, more secure websites that supports the new tools and workflows used in modern web development, and this event brought the community together to share insights, learnings, and updates. You can learn more about the community at [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/).

## Highlights

### State of the Jamstack

Matt Biilmann, who coined the term ‚ÄúJamstack‚Äù and is co-founder/CEO of Netlify, kicked off the event to discuss the state Jamstack.
