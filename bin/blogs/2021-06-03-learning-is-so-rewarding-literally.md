We are so very excited to announce that you can now be rewarded for learning, literally. Now, when you complete a mission with [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/) we give you a pack of JAMazing stickers (ok, JAMazing isn't a real word, but I couldn't help it). Let me show you how.

When you complete a mission, head back to your dashboard and there will be a new message in the 'Achievement and Rewards Section'.

![a screenshot of the achievements and rewards section](/v3/img/blog/screen_shot_2021-06-02_at_11.58.05_am_a9pcje.jpg "mission complete messaging")

Copy your reward code and click the link to see ['these stickers'](https://swag.netlify.com/product/netlify-sticker-packs) and add them to your cart.

Feel free to browse the [super sweet Swag Store](https://swag.netlify.com/) or just head straight to checkout and apply the reward code that lets everyone know what a smart cookie you are üòò.
