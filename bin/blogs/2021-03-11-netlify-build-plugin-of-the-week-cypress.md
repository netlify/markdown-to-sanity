Welcome to our series highlighting [Netlify Build Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/plugins/)! This week, we’re featuring a Build Plugin created by one of our partners: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Cypress is an end-to-end testing tool for any frontend framework or website. It makes setting up, writing, running, and debugging tests easy. We love that it’s an all-in-one tool, which means there’s no need to install 10 or more separate tools and libraries to get your test suite setup.

And with the Cypress Netlify Build Plugin, you can streamline your workflow even *further*. With a one-click install in Netlify’s UI, the plugin runs an end-to-end Cypress test with each Netlify build, so you can ship with confidence without sacrificing efficiency.

We created a plugin that runs an end-to-end Cypress test at every build. Now anyone can enable this plugin with a click in Netlify’s UI, ensuring quality and confidence with each deploy.”
