We have been using Elm at Netlify for almost a year now in our Redirects
Playground as well as our Context Explorer tool to help us know whether the
site you are viewing is a deploy preview or branch deploy.

In this episode of JAMstack Radio, I am happy to be joined with Richard
Feldman and Brooke Angel from NoRedInk, a product that focuses on building
stronger writers through an internet-based curriculum. They are also big fans
of Elm as well.

We delve into Elm and how the team at NoRedink leverage it as well as onboard
new developers using it the safety of compiler.
