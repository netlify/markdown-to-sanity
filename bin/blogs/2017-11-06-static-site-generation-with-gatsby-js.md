  you build entire websites using React.js. Kyle describes what motivated him to
  build Gatsby and compares Gatsby with Jekyll, explaining that Gatsby also
  provides a modern JavaScript and CSS development environment. He discusses the
  limitations of the initial release of Gatsby and the exciting new features in
  Gatsby 1.0 such as progressive web app enhancements and a plugin system. He
  also shares his plans to make Gatsby 2.0 more scalable by including Webpack 3
  to support larger web projects.
