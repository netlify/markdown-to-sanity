  Discuss Free Code Camp’s ‘self study together’ approach that has grown their
  community
---

In this episode of JAMstack Radio, I speak with Quincy Larson, Founder of **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)** and Berkeley Martinez, CTO of Free Code Camp.

We discuss Free Code Camp’s “self study together” approach that has grown their community to over 350,000 monthly active users. Quincy explains why they chose JavaScript as the language to teach people how to program. An important part of their curriculum is the invaluable practical training campers gain by working with non-profits and contributing to open source communities.
