[Staticgen](https://www.staticgen.com/) is a great place to check out what is happening and moving in the static site generation space. One of the new up and comers is [Spike](https://www.spike.cf/), a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and has a foundation of [html](http://reshape.ml/), [css](http://postcss.org/), and [js](http://babeljs.io/) parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. It’s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly.

In this installment of JAMstack Radio, Jeff Escalante explains how Spike was designed to be both flexible while avoiding heavy configuration  out of the box. Jeff also talks about the different factors that prompted the transition from Roots to Spike such as the complexity of the core code base that made it difficult for contributors to build plugins.
