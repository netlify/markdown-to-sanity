Today is [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/). On Tuesday night [JAMstackSF](https://www.meetup.com/jamstack-sf/) gathered at [Wikia’s](http://www.wikia.com/fandom) office to explore the topic of accessibility on the modern web.

At Netlify we’ve recently been raising the topic of accessibility internally. It’s great to be on a team where we can comfortably ask the question *“Is this accessible?”* and it’s followed with articles, tools,  opinions, and examples. Our goal is to focus on educating ourselves about the best practices around accessibility for the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) so we can bring that knowledge to the community. This is why the May JAMstackSF meetup was dedicated to accessibility.

I personally enjoyed learning more about what companies are doing to make their sites more accessible and hope these videos encourage you to take a look at your apps and sites from a different perspective.
