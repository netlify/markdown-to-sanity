I have been working programming professional for about 3 years now and
only been working in JavaScript for half that time. So when I made the
jump into the JavaScript ecosystem I needed help keepting my syntax consistent, which is how
I stumbled upon the [Airbnb Style Guide](http://airbnb.io/javascript/).

```js
// excerpt from the Airbnb style guide.

// bad
const items = new Array();

// good
const items = [];
```

I chat with Harrison about what makes for a good style guide and why they are so
important for growing engineering teams.

*After the recording of this episode we created a eslint-config-plugin that uses Airbnb's style guide as the backbone. Check it out on
[GitHub](https://github.com/netlify/eslint-config-netlify) and let us
know what you think.*
